\chaptermark{Preface}

In November 2014, representatives from over 170 governments, together
with leaders of intergovernmental organizations and civil society --
including non-governmental organizations, researchers, the private
sector, and consumer representatives -- converged in Rome for the
Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2). ICN2 was not a
technical meeting; it was organized to mobilize and unite the
international community for the protracted struggle against
malnutrition. Organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), ICN2
and its preparatory process provided both a forum and event in which
the world community, led by governments, affirmed its shared
commitment to eradicating malnutrition by adopting the Rome
Declaration, and reaching agreement on a comprehensive, harmonized
Framework for Action.

A central contribution of ICN2 was to put sustainable access to
healthy diets at the centre of food production, distribution, and
consumption.  The perspective was comprehensive. Through the Rome
Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, countries
committed to eradicate all forms of malnutrition worldwide: hunger or
‘undernourishment’ (inadequacy of dietary energy and protein intake);
undernutrition (including micronutrient deficiencies, particularly
during the ‘first thousand days’ from conception to age 2); and
obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases.

The Rome Declaration commits governments, /inter alia/, to ensure
sustainable food systems for universal access to balanced and
diversified diets. The Framework for Action sets out how to create an
enabling environment for a wide variety of effective nutrition
actions, including public policy interventions, to give effect to
these commitments. The tools recommended are manifold: nutrition
education and information; social protection to improve the
nutritional status of schoolchildren, the poor, and vulnerable;
scaled-up health system interventions to enhance nutrition; improved
drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene; and enhanced food safety.

The 2013 edition of the annual FAO flagship report, /The State of Food
and Agriculture/, took as its theme, food systems for better
nutrition, and provided important background for ICN2. The report
showed how various aspects of the food system -- from inputs and
production to transportation, processing, storage, retailing, food
preparation, and consumption -- influence the availability of diverse,
nutritious foods, and affect people's access to and utilization of
foods. Healthier, more sustainable food systems, the report showed,
are key to securing healthy diets over the course of the life-cycle
for all children, women, and men.

This book summarizes the role of food systems in improving nutrition,
and highlights the measures necessary for its implementation on a
global scale. It makes the case for more coordinated and concerted
policy approaches, as well as greater international cooperation, to
address malnutrition in all its forms. It argues for increasing food
availability through increased investments in agriculture, including
by specifically promoting investments to enhance the availability of
nutrient-rich foods. Such investments are preconditions for a major
breakthrough on nutrition, but, in many circumstances, the
/availability/ of more nutritious food by itself may not improve
nutritional outcomes. By reviewing selected experiences of using
social protection programmes to address hunger and malnutrition, this
book argues for the expansion of coverage and the design of social
protection programmes to ensure better popular /access/ to adequate
nutritious food -- by ensuring both affordability and availability
when needed. While recognizing the vital importance of appropriate
fortification and supplementation in dealing with specific
micronutrient deficiencies, the book cautions against placing
nutrition supplements at the centre of the strategy. It argues instead
for public regulation of and popular education about nutritional
supplementation to prevent abuses and to ensure that profit does not
take precedence over need.

In accord with the ICN2 consensus, the book also identifies
complementary actions required to improve nutrition. According to the
latest statistics available, about 750 million persons in the world do
not have access to safe water supply, while 2.5 billion people do not
have access to improved sanitation. Closing these gaps requires
political commitment at the highest level, involvement of all the
relevant parts and levels of government, sustained fiscal support, and
much greater popular awareness of health, nutrition, and hygiene.

The new post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to be adopted
by UN member-states in September 2015, present an extraordinary
opportunity to invigorate the commitments and practical vision that
emerged from ICN2. The ICN2 outcomes were formally welcomed in a
resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly on 6 July 2015, with a
decision made to consider other outstanding issues, including a
follow-up programme of action, soon after the September 2015 UN
Summit.

This publication is intended to provide a useful resource to
policymakers, and their partners and supporters in civil society,
expert communities, and the private sector, as they seek to transform
ICN2 commitments and recommendations into concrete actions.

Vikas Rawal coordinated the preparation of the manuscript of this
book. He is the lead author of chapters 1-5, and Michael Clark of
chapter 6, on Governance.

* Acknowledgements

This book has emerged from the lengthy expert consultations and
intergovernmental negotiations that led to the Second International
Conference on Nutrition (ICN2) and the adoption of its two outcomes --
the Rome Declaration and the Framework for Action -- by consensus in
November 2014. Jointly organized by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO), ICN2 was a culminating event that drew on and contributed to
growing global interest in nutrition. The ICN2 outcomes and their
preparatory processes brought together a large number policymakers and
experts from governments, academic and technical research institutes,
international organizations, civil society, the private sector,
foundations, and philanthropies. In so doing, it established a
comprehensive new international foundation for collaboration.

The ICN2 preparatory process began several years before, with various
consultations and materials on national circumstances and experiences
commissioned and presented to expert groups to develop an evidence
base for the conference. The FAO’s flagship report, /The State of Food
and Agriculture/, for 2013 focused on /Food Systems for Better
Nutrition/, and helped to fill an important gap in nutrition policy by
calling attention to the fundamental role of food systems in meeting --
or not meeting -- nutritional needs. It provided important guidance on
steps to be taken to promote adoption of effective, evidence-based
policies and regulation as well as informed consumers.

In this context, it is a pleasant but nonetheless challenging duty to
record the many contributions that have been made to the preparation
of this work. We must start by recognizing, /en masse/, the many
colleagues who contributed to the ICN2 process, including the
Preparatory Technical meeting in November 2013 and the complex
intergovernmental negotiations, involving national representatives
from both FAO and WHO, that produced the outcomes. The conference
itself gathered more than 2,200 world leaders engaged in all aspects
of nutrition work. Statements and declarations issued by individuals
and groups at the plenary sessions, round tables, side events as well
as at the four pre-conference events -- the Scaling-Up Nutrition (SUN)
Movement Global Gathering, as well as gatherings for parliamentarians,
civil society and the private sector -- further enriched the conference
deliberations.

Some specific debts must be acknowledged. The entire ICN2 process
could not have taken place without the crucial support of the
Director-General of FAO, Jose Graziano da Silva, his counterpart
Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO, Oleg Chestnov, Jomo’s WHO
counterpart, as well as Fernanda Guerrieri, then FAO Directeur de
Cabinet, and Coumba Sow from her office. Anna Lartey, FAO’s Director
of Nutrition, and Francesco Branca, her counterpart at WHO, have been
patient, generous, and reliable guides through the demanding
intellectual, technical, policy, and political journey to build global
consensus on nutrition issues. Vital insight was offered at critical
moments by Per Pinstrup-Anderson, David Nabarro, Flavio Valente, and
others who helped set both the scope and tone for ICN2, and thereby
influenced important judgments presented in this book. Virtually the
entire FAO Nutrition Division, including Brian Thompson, Ali Mekouar,
and Leslie Amoroso, made important contributions to the ICN2 process
and outcomes, and thus to the views expressed herein. Dan Gustafson,
Anna Lartey, and Dipa Sinha offered important comments, while Terri
Raney, Andre Croppenstedt, and the SOFA editorial team who produced
SOFA 2013 provided an important foundation for the perspective offered
here.

The authors wish to express their thanks to FAO's Nutrition Division,
and it's Director, Anna Lartey, for their strong support in all
aspects of the preparation of this book. The production of this book
benefited from the institutional support of FAO’s Office of Corporate
Communications, especially Jessica Mathewson, and the Society for
Social and Economic Research in Delhi, and from the work of research
assistants Mampi Bose, Bhawna Mangla, and Vaishali Bansal. Shad
Naved's careful copy-editing of the manuscript is gratefully
acknowledged. In addition, for all the statistical work and writing,
the authors relied on R ([[http://www.r-project.org][www.r-project.org]]), org ([[http://www.orgmode.org][www.orgmode.org]]),
and LaTeX. All three are open source projects, freely made available
by very vibrant communities of developers. During the course of the
work, we often drew on support from these communities.

Finally, special thanks are owed to Tulika Books, and in particular,
Indu Chandrasekhar, for approaching the publication in a spirit of
true partnership that we hope will make the work accessible to a wider
audience than would normally be the case.

While wishing to recognize the many sources of evidence and insight,
criticism and encouragement that we have received in the preparation
of this work, the authors take sole responsibility for the views
expressed.

At the First International Conference on Nutrition in 1992, world
leaders made clear in the World Declaration on Nutrition that, “Hunger
and malnutrition are unacceptable in a world that has both the
knowledge and resources to end this form of catastrophe.” Over two
decades later, the world continues to face several nutrition-related
challenges.

In November 2014, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) co-organized the
\index{Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2)} Second
International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2), which brought together
international organizations, national policy makers, practitioners and
experts, to lay out a road map for coordinated action to ensure that
no one in the world is left hungry and suffering from malnutrition.

How serious is the problem of malnutrition? Which regions face the
various forms of malnutrition the most? Who are the most affected and
vulnerable? What are the implications of malnutrition for the
malnourished and for the world at large? What are the pros and cons of
different policy instruments available to tackle malnutrition?  What
is the role of food systems in the strategy to end malnutrition?  How
useful are other means to provide nutrients? What are the means to
improve absorption of nutrients?

These are some of the questions addressed in this book. It is argued
here that ending malnutrition in all its forms -- caloric
undernourishment, micronutrient deficiencies, and diet-related
non-communicable diseases often associated with obesity -- requires a
combination of appropriate interventions in food systems, public
health, provision of safe water and sanitation, education, and social
protection to guarantee the availability of and access to diverse
diets; to reduce the susceptibility to disease; to improve the
absorption of nutrients; and to increase consumer awareness of the
importance of good nutrition. With widespread deprivation,
unemployment, underemployment, growing inequalities as well as a slow
and skewed economic recovery, a basic universal social protection
floor will be crucial to guarantee access to nutritious food. While
the use of nutritional supplements may be important in the short run,
and in dealing with nutritional deficiencies faced by pregnant women
and young children, in the medium and long term, a sustainable
reduction in malnutrition requires a balanced diet. Access to safe
water, improved sanitation, hygienic living conditions and basic
health care are crucial for better retention and absorption of
nutrients consumed by people. Sustained commitment to filling large
gaps in these areas is imperative for dealing with malnutrition.

The ICN2 adopted two outcome documents: the Rome Declaration on
Nutrition (Appendix [[ICN2: Rome Declaration on Nutrition]]) and the ICN2
Framework for Action (Appendix [[ICN2: Framework for Action]]). The Rome
Declaration on Nutrition, signed by representatives of over 170
countries that participated in the ICN2, gave a call for global action
to end all forms of malnutrition. It identified focus areas for
coordinated action. The ICN2 Framework for Action provides crucial
policy guidance for governments to work towards meeting these
objectives.

** Hunger and malnutrition in the world today

The latest Food and Agriculture Organization estimate of the
\index{Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU)} Prevalence of
Undernourishment shows that, despite abundant food supplies and
considerable progress in reducing hunger in some regions, more than
795 million people had chronically inadequate levels of dietary energy
intake during 2014--16 citep:sofi2015.

“Hidden hunger”, or micronutrient deficiencies, is much more
widespread than hunger, which only refers to inadequate dietary energy
intake. Although there is a paucity of regular and time-series data on
micronutrient deficiencies, there is no doubt that the number of
people who suffer one or more forms of micronutrient deficiency is
staggering and much more than the number of people who chronically
experience inadequate dietary energy.[fn:1]

According to the latest data available from the World Health
Organization’s \index{World Health Organization (WHO)} Vitamin and
Mineral Nutrition Information System, about 1.6 billion people
globally are \index{anaemia} anaemic.[fn:2] Iron deficiency, the
primary cause of anaemia, is only one micronutrient among many --
vitamin A, zinc, and iodine, to name a few -- missing from or
insufficiently included in the diets of many around the
world. According to data from the WHO’s Global Database on Iodine
Deficiency, \index{iodine deficiency} in 2003, about 2 billion people
of all ages and about 285 million school-age children globally
suffered from iodine deficiency citep:benoist2003. Estimates for
1995--2005 show that 190 million pre-school children and 19.1 million
pregnant women globally had \index{vitamin A deficiency} vitamin A
deficiency, while about 5.2 million pre-school children and 9.8
#+index: women
million pregnant women consequently suffered night blindness
citep:whovitamin12009. Meanwhile, more than 1.5 billion people are
overweight with half a billion \index{obesity} obese, exposing them to
greater risk of cardiovascular problems and other diet-related,
non-communicable diseases.

** Reducing caloric undernourishment

\index{Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU)|(}

At the 1996 World Food Summit (WFS), heads of government and the world
community committed to halving the /number/ of hungry people in the
world recorded in 1990 by 2015.
#+index: Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
Five years later, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) lowered the
target to reducing the /proportion/ of hungry people in the world by
half. Considerable efforts have been made in many countries to reach
these targets. Twenty-nine developing countries have made impressive
progress, achieving the more ambitious WFS target, while 72 developing
countries have achieved the MDG target of halving the proportion of
hungry people citep:sofi2015.

Undernourishment is conventionally measured in terms of adequacy of
energy in the diet. FAO’s Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) is an
internationally comparable, statistically validated, and widely
accepted measure of the chronic inadequacy of dietary energy. Given
serious data limitations, a methodologically consistent estimate of
the prevalence of hunger can only be made for a relatively low
benchmark of dietary energy requirement. The estimates of the number
of hungry people in the world are also probably compromised by data
and methodological limitations.[fn:3]

Globally, the estimate of the proportion of people unable to consume
minimum levels of dietary energy fell from 18.6 percent in 1990--92 to
10.9 percent in 2014--16. Over the same period, the proportion in
developing countries fell from 23.3 percent to 12.9 percent (Table
[[undernourishment-trends]]). While this is significant progress, it falls
short -- by 116 million persons -- of meeting the less ambitious MDG
Target 1c of halving the share of chronically undernourished
people. Unfortunately, the recent slowdown in progress is not
encouraging citep:sofi2015.

\index{State of Food Insecurity Report (SOFI)} The 2012 /State of Food
Insecurity Report/ provided additional measures of prevalence of
inadequacy of dietary energy, using different benchmarks of minimum
dietary energy requirement citep:sofi2012. The report showed that, in
comparison with the methodologically most consistent PoU estimate of
14.9 percent in 2010--12, the estimate of the proportion of persons
facing dietary inadequacy turned out to be 26.5 percent, if the
dietary energy requirement benchmark was assumed to correspond to the
minimum dietary energy needs associated with normal levels of physical
activity. As per this indicator, referred to as Prevalence of Food
Inadequacy (2), in 2010--12, 1.5 billion people globally faced dietary
energy inadequacy.[fn:4]

Whether or not the MDG Target is achieved, the overall progress has
been highly uneven. About 795 million people -- one in ten people
worldwide -- remain chronically hungry even by the conservative
definition used in estimating the Prevalence of Undernourishment. Of
these, only about 14 million of the world’s hungry live in developed
countries. Some countries and regions have seen only modest progress
in reducing hunger. In several countries, the number of hungry people
has increased. Meanwhile, there have been significant reductions in
the prevalence of undernourishment in most countries of Southeast
Asia, Latin America, East Asia, Central Asia, and the Caribbean where
the target of halving the hunger rate has been reached, or nearly
reached (Table [[undernourishment-trends]]).

Progress in Sub-Saharan Africa has been limited, and the region has
the highest prevalence of undernourishment by far, with almost one in
four chronically hungry. Meanwhile, the more populous South Asia still
has many more undernourished people. Progress in South Asia and
Oceania has not been sufficient to meet the MDG hunger target by 2015,
while West Asia and North Africa have had a rising Prevalence of
Undernourishment (Table [[undernourishment-trends]]). Figure [[poumap]] shows
the country-level variation in Prevalence of Undernourishment. Figure
[[poumap2]] shows that countries in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have
not been able to make it to the finishing line for the WFS and the MDG
targets on hunger.

** Slow and uneven progress in reducing malnutrition

Progress in reducing malnutrition has been slower and more
uneven. Globally, about 15 percent of all children under 5 years of
age continue to be underweight. Between 1990 and 2012, the number of
underweight children aged less than 5 years declined by about 38
percent, from about 160 million to about 99 million, well short of the
MDG Target 1c (Table [[underweight-trends]]).

\index{World Health Assembly!targets|(} In 2012, the World Health
Assembly agreed to the following six global targets:

+ Reduce by 40 percent the number of children under 5 who are
  stunted
+ Achieve a 50 percent reduction in the rate of anaemia in women of
  reproductive age
+ Achieve a 30 percent reduction in the rate of infants born with low
  birth weight
+ Ensure that there is no increase in the rate of children who are
  overweight
+ Increase to at least 50 percent the rate of exclusive breastfeeding
  in the first six months
+ Reduce and maintain childhood wasting to less than 5 percent.

The recent \index{Global Nutrition Report} /Global Nutrition Report/
shows that at the current pace of change, the world is not on course
to meet any of these targets citep:gnr14. The report includes a
detailed study of progress on four of these targets: targets related
to stunting, wasting, overweight, and anaemia. Data on all the four
indicators were available only for 99 countries. The report found that
only one country of these (Colombia) was on course to meet all the
four targets, and thirty-one countries were not on course to meet any
of the four targets.

There are significant regional variations in malnutrition trends. East
Asia has led all regions with a decline in the prevalence of
underweight children to below 3 percent, followed by Central Asia,
Latin America and the Caribbean, and West Asia. South Asia, with a 41
percent decline in the prevalence of underweight children, continues
to be home to the largest number of underweight children. There were
52 million underweight pre-school children in South Asia
in 2012. Despite a 29 percent increase in the proportion of
underweight children, Sub-Saharan Africa had 5 million more
underweight children in 2012 than in 1990 (Table [[underweight-trends]]).

\index{stunting|(}A quarter of the children in the world, and a third
in developing countries, are stunted due to a range of factors
including poor diet. Four out of five stunted children live in just
twenty countries, including almost half of Indian children under the
age of 5. Although the prevalence of stunting fell from an estimated
40 percent in 1990 to about 25 percent in 2012, an estimated 162
million children under 5 remain at risk of diminished cognitive and
physical development associated with such chronic undernutrition
(Table [[stunting-trends]]).

Nearly all regions of the world have experienced a decline in the
number of children affected by stunting. The exception is Sub-Saharan
Africa, where the number of stunted children increased by a third,
from 44 million to 58 million, between 1990 and 2012 (Table
[[stunting-trends]]). In Nigeria, over half of the poorest children are
stunted, while children in poor rural counties in China are six times
more likely to be stunted than urban children. In Indonesia, a sharp
rise in wasting -- or acute undernutrition -- in the wake of the recent
food crisis hit children from the poorest households
hardest. \index{stunting|)}

** Consequences of malnutrition

Micronutrient deficiencies impair cognitive and physical development,
especially among young children, making people less able to learn and
work, as well as more susceptible to disease and reduced life
expectancy.[fn:5] A detailed review of studies and statistical
evidence found that about 3.7 million child deaths were associated
with maternal or child underweight status. These deaths and increased
morbidity among children, from pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria
associated with low weight-for-age, accounted for a loss of about 127
million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)
citep:healthquantification1.  citet:susan2008 estimated excess
mortality globally attributable to different types of
malnutrition. She found 3.75 million deaths associated with being
underweight; 0.84 million deaths due to iron deficiency; 0.78 million
deaths because of vitamin A deficiency; 0.79 million deaths because of
zinc deficiency; and 2.59 million deaths associated with being
overweight. Of the 8.75 million excess deaths on account of
malnutrition, about 3 million were in Sub-Saharan Africa, and 2.34
million in South and Southeast Asia citep:susan2008.

Studies have noted that receiving the right nutrients in the earliest
years of life is not only a matter of life and death, but also a major
determinant of future life chances. The evidence summarized by
citet:healthquantification1 shows that early child undernutrition is
associated with impaired cognitive development and lasting
intellectual deficits. Undernutrition among adults also results in
diminished work capacity and lower productivity.

There have been some attempts at quantifying the economic consequences
of malnutrition. Although such estimates have methodological
limitations, it is clear that the economic consequences of
malnutrition, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable, are
staggering. For example, using data from ten developing countries,
citet:horton2003economics showed that the median value of per capita
annual losses on account of reduced productivity and reduced cognitive
abilities due to iron deficiency was about US$3.64 per year. For
India, they estimated the value of losses on account of reduced
productivity and cognitive abilities to be around US$4.8 per capita
per year. The estimated costs of malnutrition would be much higher if
the increased costs of health care due to malnutrition are taken into
account. The present discounted value of the lifetime costs of
malnutrition due to excess mortality, additional health-care costs,
and loss of lifetime productivity and cognitive abilities have been
estimated to be more than US$500 per capita
citep:alderman2004,shekar2006repositioning and US$2.8--3.5 trillion
globally citep:sofa2013.

As rightly pointed out in the Rome Declaration on Nutrition,
"malnutrition, in all its forms, including undernutrition,
micronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity, not only affects
people’s health and well-being by impacting negatively on human
physical and cognitive development, compromising the immune system,
increasing susceptibility to communicable and noncommunicable
diseases, restricting the attainment of human potential and reducing
productivity, but also poses a high burden in the form of negative
social and economic consequences to individuals, families, communities
and States."

* Transforming Food Systems to Provide Healthy Diets for All

\chaptermark{Transforming Food Systems}

Improving food systems is key to fostering more balanced, diversified,
and healthier diets. As shown by FAO’s 2013 report on /The State of
Food and Agriculture/, \index{State of Food and Agriculture (SOFA)}
food systems must be improved in ways that make such foods available
and affordable \citep{sofa2013}. Everyone should have access to a wide
range of nutritious foods and be able to make healthy dietary
choices. Consumers need help in making better informed dietary choices
for improved nutrition with education, information, regulation, and
other interventions. Improvements in post-harvest processing, storage,
and marketing systems can reduce food losses and contribute to more
sustainable resource use.

Regions and countries with the highest burden of micronutrient
deficiencies also have a high prevalence of stunting and heavy disease
burdens. The problems are closely connected and thus require a
systemic approach involving all relevant sectors if we are to make
progress. The food system involves people, institutions, agricultural
production, processing, storage, retailing, transportation, commerce,
international trade, and consumption. Improved nutrition involves and
depends on every aspect of the food system. This is why an integrated
approach is needed to ensure that food consumed is adequate,
nutritious, wholesome, acceptable, safe, and affordable, especially to
the poorest and the most vulnerable.

Creating sustainable and healthy food systems is key to overcoming
hunger and malnutrition around the world. But food systems often do
not function in ways most conducive to ensuring that everyone has
access to safe food and nutritionally adequate diets. Improving food
systems requires a systemic approach to deal with problems of food
availability, food access, food safety, and of sustainability. We have
to increase our efforts to address these problems.

** Food availability

\index{food availability|(} Globally, food production has more than
tripled since 1961. The FAO's index of net food production, which
measures changes in food production over time, increased from 34 in
1961 to 123 in 2013. Over this period, average food production per
person increased by about 50 percent, with the index of per capita net
food production increasing from 73 in 1961 to 123 in 2013 (Figure
[[food-production]]).

While the world produces enough food to feed everyone, there are
deficits in food availability in various parts of the
world. Inadequate production capacity at the national level, poor
storage facilities and other infrastructure, and trade barriers still
result in localized shortages in food availability.

#+begin_infobox

The Sahel and the Horn of Africa are regions frequently hit by
drought, poor harvests, and pasture deficits. About 20 million people
are affected by food insecurity in the Sahel, and are likely to see
their situation further deteriorate in 2015. Adversities on account of
fragile ecological conditions have been compounded by conflicts in
many countries in the region, which have resulted in large-scale
displacement of people and disruption of livelihoods.

A Special Alert issued by the \citet{giewssahel2010} described the
conditions in Sahel thus:

\begin{myquote}

\noindent In 2009, agricultural production has been seriously
affected in parts of the Sahel following late onset of rains,
prolonged dry spells and significant pest infestations. The eastern
and central parts of the Subregion were most affected with cereal
outputs estimated to have declined by 30 percent in Niger, 17 percent
in Burkina Faso and 11 percent in Chad, compared to 2008. Although
favourable growing conditions boosted cereal output in most of the
western part, irregular rains led to a 24 percent drop in cereal
production in Mauritania.

In addition to the decline in cereal production, pastures were
seriously affected in the pastoral and agro-pastoral zones of
Sahel. For instance, biomass production in pastoral areas of Niger in
2009 was estimated to be 62 percent below domestic requirements. This
deficit is three times as severe as in the previous year. In Chad, a
death rate of about 31 percent for cattle was reported in west--central
areas, while in Mali, significant livestock deaths were reported in
Timbuktu, Gao, Ségou and Kidal regions.

\end{myquote}

Significant shortfall (over 30 percent in many areas) in Deyr rains
(October--December) in 2010 and poor performance of Gu rains
(April--June) in 2011 caused an extreme drought across the Horn of
Africa, affecting over 13 million people. The impact of drought was
further compounded by high food prices, very low levels of resilience
on account of prolonged ecological stress, political conflicts and
underdevelopment, and inadequate and delayed humanitarian
assistance. In Somalia, the country that was worst affected, cereal
production fell by about 70 percent. In pastoral areas, rainfall
deficit significantly affected pasture growth, resulted in a decline
in the availability of crop-residue fodder and production of
livestock. Despite well-functioning early warning systems, conflicts
in the region and consequent restrictions imposed on humanitarian
assistance resulted in a famine that caused 260,000 deaths in southern
and central \index{Somalia} Somalia alone. A detailed study
commissioned by FAO's Food and Nutrition Security Analysis Unit for
Somalia and \index{USAID!FEWS NET} USAID's Famine Early Warning System
Network (FEWS NET) estimated that between October 2010 and April 2012,
the period of famine, more than 133,000 children under 5 years of age
died in southern and central \index{Somalia} Somalia on account of
famine. The highest famine-related mortality was in the Lower Shabelle
region, where famine resulted in death of 9 percent of the population
and about 18 percent of all children aged less than 5 years.

\noindent disruption of local markets, pushing about half a million
people into severe food insecurity.

Disruption of rural livelihoods because of conflicts and disasters
typically results in large-scale displacement and forces people to
migrate, intensifying competition for scarce employment opportunities
in non-agricultural activities, enhancing dependence on markets to
obtain food, and increasing unsustainable exploitation of natural
resources parencite:sofi2010.

A more widespread problem on the supply side is the lack of adequate
supply of different types of foods that should be part of a
nutritionally adequate diet. Table [[food-supply-region]] shows the
average annual per capita supply of different types of food in
different regions of the world. The table shows that Eastern and
Southern Africa have the lowest average per capita supply

#+begin_infobox

In 2014, the Ebola epidemic affected some of the most agriculturally
advanced regions of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with an adverse
impact on agricultural production as well as household incomes from
other activities. Trade restrictions in the face of the epidemic
further contributed to problems of food availability as all three
countries are net importers of food.

Reports from FAO and WFP suggest that restrictions on trade, hunting,
and other economic activities have resulted in a large number of
people experiencing severe levels of food insecurity. It was estimated
that Ebola pushed 230,000 people in Guinea to severe food
insecurity. In Liberia, 170,000 people were estimated to be severely
food insecure because of the impact of Ebola. In Sierra Leone, the
Ebola epidemic accounted for the severe food insecurity faced by
120,000 people.

The Ebola epidemic adversely affected domestic agricultural production
in the three countries. The FAO--WFP assessment estimated that food
crop production in Guinea in 2014 would be about 3 percent lower
than in the previous year. In Liberia, the Ebola epidemic, which
coincided with crop-growing and harvesting periods, resulted in an 8
percent drop in food crop production from the previous year. In Sierra
Leone, aggregate food production was lower by about 5 percent. In the
most fertile Kailahun district, rice production was estimated to be
lower by about 17 percent.

Farms faced problems of labour shortages and market disruption as
people feared the disease. With dysfunctional markets, transport and
trade infrastructure within the affected countries, surplus producers
were unable to sell their produce while consumers did not have access
to food.

The Ebola epidemic affected not just domestic production in these
countries. With international trade and border restrictions, export
earnings fell sharply, resulting in considerably lower capacity of
these countries to import food.

\index{fruit and vegetables!supply of|(}

\noindent of fruits and vegetables. If we use the WHO norm of 400
grams of fruits and vegetable consumption per capita per day, all of
Africa (except the north), South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central
America do not even have supplies of fruits and vegetables to meet
that level of consumption. Fruits and vegetables are often seasonally
produced and highly perishable. It is estimated that, globally, about
17 percent of fruits and vegetables are lost between farm and
plate.[fn:6] If one takes into account losses and waste, there would
be considerable shortfalls in the availability of fruits and
vegetables in most parts of the world.

Several factors constrain the supply of fruits and vegetables. The
high costs and riskiness of production, poor access to credit, poor
coverage and quality of extension services, and labour shortages
during periods of peak labour requirement are among the factors that
constrain the expansion of production of fruits and vegetables. On the
other hand, limited shelf-life, poor packaging, storage and
transportation, as well as price volatility and seasonality constrain
the supply and marketing of fruits and vegetables.[fn:7]

\index{fruit and vegetables!supply of|)}

Recommended levels of intake for most other types of foods, as
specified in Food-based Dietary Guidelines of different countries,
vary across countries and with population groups. It is nevertheless
useful to have an overview of variations in the supply of different
types of food across regions and countries. There are wide variations
-- from very little to very high levels of supply driven by excessive
consumption -- in the supply of animal-source foods across different
regions of the world. In 2011, Europe, Oceania and North America had
milk supplies of over 200 kilograms per capita per year, while it was
only 48 kilograms of milk per capita per year in Africa, and 58
kilograms per capita per year in Asia. In the case of meats and
offals, Oceania and North America had a per capita supply of over 100
kilograms per year, while it was only 20 kilograms per capita per year
in Africa, 33 kilograms per capita per year in Asia, and 44 kilograms
per capita per year in the world as a whole (Table
[[food-supply-region]]).

As seen in Figures [[cereal-supply-region]]--[[animal-supply-region]], there
are considerable variations in the supply of different types of food
across countries within each region.

** Access to adequate and nutritious food

Access to food is a critical dimension of food security. Having access
to food requires that people have command over adequate resources to
be able to acquire -- through own-production, purchase or public
provision -- adequate and nutritious food. This brings into focus
issues like access to land and other productive resources, household
incomes and food prices. In addition, there is also the issue of
physical access to food, particularly for people living in remote
areas that do not have good transport and storage infrastructure, and
for perishable food items, which lose their nutritional value and
wholesomeness quickly under poor storage conditions.

*** Food prices and access to food

\index{food prices!global|(}

The world saw sharp rises in global food prices in 2007--08 and
2010--11. These price spikes were fuelled, most importantly, by a
mandated increase in the use of food crops for biofuels, resulting in
increased integration of food and oil prices, and increased
speculation in commodity prices. Systematic reviews of evidence from
across the world show that the food price spikes of 2007--08 and
2010--11 adversely affected the food security of the world's poor
parencite:hlpe1,sofi2008,sofi2011. Although high food prices, if
transmitted to producers, benefit surplus producers, the vast
proportion of the urban and rural poor are net buyers of food, and are
adversely hit by rising food prices. The high volatility of food
prices creates considerable uncertainty in the food system and
discourages long-term investment parencite:hlpe1,sofi2011. High food
prices particularly hit poor buyers of food who spend large shares of
their incomes on food. Empirical evidence also shows that rising
global food prices in 2007--08 and 2010--11 adversely affected dietary
diversity, as the poor shifted to the most inexpensive and
nutrient-poor food items to meet their dietary energy
requirements. Such dietary changes have increased micronutrient
deficiencies and exacerbated malnutrition among children
parencite:hlpe1.

With the easing of global food prices, there has been some decline in
the proportion of undernourished people globally. However, according
to the latest Prevalence of Undernourishment estimates (Table
[[undernourishment-trends]]), about 800 million people still do not get to
consume enough food to meet even their minimum dietary energy
requirements.

#+NAME: box-india-milk
#+attr_latex: :options [India's White Revolution and Increased Milk Availability]
#+begin_infobox

The White Revolution turned India, once a major importer of milk, into
the world's biggest producer of milk (Figure [[milk-india]]). Since the
early 1970s, milk production in India has increased six-fold, from
about 20 million tonnes to over 120 million tonnes. What makes this
huge growth of the dairy sector unique is that it is based on
small-scale, household-level milk production, and a massive network of
marketing and service cooperatives. India's Operation Flood, as the
public programme for organizing the dairy sector was called, envisaged
organizing small, household-level dairy farmers into a structure of
village-, district- and State-level cooperatives. Milk produced by
small-scale dairy farmers is procured by village-level dairy
cooperatives and transported to a district-level milk union, where it
is processed and then marketed through a State-level federation of
dairy unions parencite:kurien2004india. Starting from a single
district in Gujarat State, over the last four decades, about 15
million dairy farmers have been organized through 150,000
village-level primary cooperatives and 183 district-level unions.

#+RESULTS: milk-india-in
[[file:milkindia.png]]

The organization of small-scale producers under the umbrella of
State-level federations and district-level unions has facilitated
dissemination of state-of-the-art technical services. Dairy farmers
and other workers were provided with modern equipment and trained in
hygienic work practices to ensure uncontaminated production,
collection, and distribution. Modern veterinary services were made
available through the network of cooperatives.

Cross-breeding was facilitated by training leading dairy farmers in
thousands of villages to provide artificial insemination
services. Currently, about 50 million cattle are cross-bred annually
using artificial insemination
(www.nddb.org/English/Statistics/Pages/Performed-States.aspx). Cross-breeding
has resulted in significant increases in the milk yield of cattle
parencite:gautamlivestock2009. The increased supply of feed
concentrates, from about 1.7 thousand tonnes per day in the 1970s to
about 5.2 thousand tonnes per day in 2002, also helped raise the milk
yield of the animals.

It was recognized early that providing remunerative prices to dairy
farmers was critical for growth in the sector parencite:lkjha1984. An
important aspect of the policy was to provide remunerative prices to
dairy farmers through fat-based pricing of milk. Inexpensive
techniques for measurement of fat content facilitated scaling up
procurement using fat content as the basis for pricing, while
discouraging the dilution and adulteration of milk.

Milk processing plants set up at the level of district unions allowed
for cold storage as well as drying of milk. Drying milk during the
peak seasons and its reconstitution during the lean summer months not
only helped reduce seasonal variations in milk supply, but also
facilitated transportation from regions of surplus production to
regions of low supply. Insulated train wagons and refrigerated trucks
have also been used to build a National Milk Grid to transport milk
from regions of surplus to regions of deficit
parencite:cunningham2009rural.

The huge expansion of the dairy sector in India has facilitated a
significant increase in the availability and consumption of milk and
dairy products in India. Since Operation Flood was launched, the per
capita availability of milk has almost tripled, from about 110 grams
per capita per day to about 290 grams per capita per day (Figure
[[milk-india]]). According to data from the consumer expenditure surveys
conducted by the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) in India,
#+index: National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO)
average milk consumption increased from about 45 kilograms per capita
per annum in 1983 to about 57 kilograms per capita per annum in
2009--10 (Table \ref{milk-consumption-india}).

Given the very low consumption of other animal-source foods in India,
milk is an important source of protein in Indian diets. By empowering
small producers, Operation Flood led to a very impressive expansion of
the dairy sector. This has had extremely important implications, not
only for incomes of dairy farmers in India, but for overall levels of
nutrition in the country.

\index{diet quality!home gardens and|(}

#+NAME: box-homegardening
#+attr_latex: :options [Home Gardens Significantly Improve Diet Diversity]
#+begin_infobox

Across the world, home gardens have been an important source of
nutritious food. Home gardens are agro-forestry units in which a
combination of trees, seasonal crops, and animals are raised
parencite:fernandes1986. Households can produce a variety of foods by
maintaining home gardens in marginal spaces on or adjacent to
homesteads. Proximity to home facilitates the tending of kitchen
gardens and helps minimize loss of nutrients due to storage and
transportation, as freshly plucked fruits and vegetables can be used
as household food.

Home gardens only require modest financial resources and can be
maintained using the household's own idle labour
parencite:john2014homestead. Being on or adjacent to homesteads, in
many regions, home gardens are primarily maintained by women, who
combine work on the gardens with other household chores. In India,
national statistics for 2011--12 show that about a quarter of rural
women who were principally engaged in housework and about 8 percent of
urban women principally engaged in housework regularly maintained home
gardens parencite:rawalsaha2015.

Studies across the world show that home gardens are /in situ/
repositories of considerable biodiversity. citet:fernandes1986 point
out that plant diversity is a characteristic feature of home gardens
across different ecological and social contexts. A study of about 300
home gardens in Java, Indonesia, recorded over 500 different plant
species. A study of twenty home gardens in Nicaragua found a total of
324 species parencite:mendez2001. A study of a Peruvian village
recorded 168 species in twenty one home gardens
parencite:padoch1991. A study of 134 home gardens in Nepal found a
total of 165 crop species parencite:sunwar2006home. In a study of 400
home gardens in Kerala, India, citet:john1997 found that the number of
plant species in a typical four-tier home garden ranged from five to
forty. A study of 80 Mayan home gardens in Mexico recorded 150
different species parencite:de2000plant.  citet:okafor1987compound
found that home gardens in Nigeria, comprising trees, shrubs,
agricultural crops, and small livestock, were germplasm banks for a
large number of plant species disappearing outside those spaces.

citet:fernandes1986 point out that among trees, fruit trees dominate
home gardens across ecological settings: "while the fruit trees such
as guava, rambutan, mango, mangosteen, and so on, along with other
food-producing trees such as /Moringa/ sp. and /Sesbania grandiflora/,
dominate the Asian home gardens, indigenous trees that produce leafy
vegetables (/Pterocarpus/ spp.), fruit for cooking (/Dacroydes
edulis/), condiment (/Pentaclethra macrophylla/), and so on, dominate
the West African compound farms". Given this rich biodiversity,
produce from home gardens not only makes a significant contribution to
the food consumption of households, but is also particularly important
for dietary diversity.

In many countries, projects supporting home gardening, by providing
seeds for a diverse variety of plants, other inputs and credit, and
through awareness and training programmes among households, have
brought considerable benefit in terms of nutritional
outcomes. Distribution of homesteads as part of the land reform
programme in West Bengal, India, resulted in greater use of homesteads
for growing fruits and vegetables, fish-farming in small homestead
ponds, and maintenance of small animals on homesteads.

Evidence from many countries has shown that maintenance of home
gardens is associated with improved intake of nutrients and improved
nutritional outcomes. citet:berti2004 systematically reviewed evidence
on the impact of agricultural interventions in Africa, Asia, and the
Americas on nutrition. Of the thirty projects reviewed by them,
eighteen were home gardening (vegetable and livestock) projects. In
all the home gardening projects, improvements in diet were
recorded. Of the six home gardening projects where anthropometric
indicators were monitored, three recorded significant improvements. In
seven studies where biochemical/clinical indicators were monitored,
four recorded improvements in biochemical/clinical indicators for
different types of micronutrient deficiencies on account of home
gardens. citet:talukder2010homestead evaluated the impact of homestead
gardening programmes in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Philippines, and Nepal,
and found improved diets among households that participated in these
programmes, resulting in faster reduction of anaemia among children
from such households compared to children from control households.

\noindent covering studies from many developed countries. They used
energy density (defined as calories available per unit weight of food)
as a negative measure of diet quality (that is, the higher the energy
density, the poorer the quality of diet). Their review showed that
better socio-economic \index{diet quality!energy density of food and}
conditions, as reflected in occupational status, level of education
and incomes, are associated with greater consumption of foods with low
energy density and high vitamin and mineral content, such as whole
grains, lean meat, fish, fruits, and vegetables. On the other hand,
the diets of persons belonging to the lower socio-economic categories
consist of food that is "energy-dense but
nutrient-poor". citet:darmon2008 point out that other studies using
multidimensional indices of diet quality have also found similar
relationships between diet quality and economic conditions.

Recent evidence from the United States and the United Kingdom suggests
that disparities in quality of diet across socio-economic groups may
even have intensified over time. A recent widely cited study of diet
quality in the United States shows that persons with relatively high
socio-economic status have more diverse and nutritious diets than
those with relatively low socio-economic status, and that the diet gap
between the rich and the poor has increased between 1999 and 2010
parencite:wang2014trends. The study used a multidimensional Alternate
Healthy Eating Index to measure diet quality, and found a positive
relationship of diet quality with family income and education
levels. Using income and educational levels, it classified the sample
into two categories by socio-economic status. The study found that
while the diet quality of the group classified as having high
socio-economic status improved significantly between 1999--2000 and
2009--10, no significant trend was seen in the diet quality of the
low-socio-economic status group parencite:wang2014trends.

\index{diet quality!energy density of food and|(}

Empirical evidence clearly shows that energy-dense foods such as
refined grains, sugars and fats are the cheapest sources of dietary
energy, while fruits and vegetables are the most expensive sources of
dietary energy
parencite:drewnowski2005,darmon2004energy,andrieu2006low,drewnowski2010. Table
[[energy-cost-us]] gives data on the average energy density of different
food groups. These data clearly show that energy-dense foods -- grain
products, fats, and sugars -- have the lowest unit cost of
calories. Compared to grains, fats and sugars, on average,
animal-source foods have lower energy density and higher energy
cost. Fruits and vegetables have the lowest energy density and highest
energy cost. Data on energy costs from France presented in Table
[[energy-cost-france]] also show similar ranking for different food
items. While human diets also have social and cultural determinants,
the high energy cost of foods with low energy density is the most
important reason why the diets of low-income households consist of
very low quantities of nutritious food commodities. Evidence on the
costs of different types of diets in \index{South Africa} South Africa
is similar parencite:temple2011,temple2009food,temple2011price. Table
[[energy-cost-uk]], taken from citet:nicholas2014, shows that, in the
United Kingdom, the average price per unit of dietary energy from
fruits and vegetables was £ 9.13/1000 kcal, while one could get 1000
kcal of dietary energy by spending only £ 1.26 on bread, potatoes, and
pasta. Detailed statistical analysis presented by citet:nicholas2014
shows that the price gap between less healthy food items and their
more healthy alternatives had increased in the United Kingdom between
2002 and 2012.

Evidence from developing countries also shows significant differences
in the pattern of food consumption across different economic
classes. Data from household consumer expenditure surveys of
developing countries show that cereals dominate the food consumption
of the poor, while more affluent households spend a greater share of
their food expenditure on food of animal origin (meat, fish, eggs, and
milk). Tables [[food-expenditure-indonesia]]--[[food-expenditure-india]] show
\index{India} these patterns for Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa,
and India. Table [[food-expenditure-indonesia]] shows that, in both rural
and urban Indonesia, the share of cereals and tubers declines as one
goes from the poorest expenditure class to the higher expenditure
classes, while the share of animal-source high-protein food
rises. According to the 2009--10 Household Expenditure Survey in
\index{Malaysia} Malaysia, the share of animal-source foods in total
household food expenditure increased from 39 percent for the lowest
two expenditure classes to 46 percent in the top five expenditure
classes (Table [[food-expenditure-malaysia]]). Table [[food-expenditure-sa]]
shows a similar pattern for South Africa, with the share of
animal-source foods rising from 32 percent for the poorest expenditure
decile to 38 percent for the top decile. \index{South Africa}

Data for all four countries presented here show that, while the
absolute quantity of consumption of fruits and vegetables rises as one
goes from poor to more affluent households, the rise is considerably
less than that for animal-source food. As a result, the share of
fruits and vegetables in total consumption does not show any
significant change across expenditure classes or
deciles. \index{Indonesia} In Indonesia, across most rural and urban
expenditure classes, fruits and vegetables accounted for about 13--14
percent of food expenditure in 2013. In Malaysia, between 15--17
percent of food expenditure was on \index{Malaysia} fruits and
vegetables by households in all expenditure classes. In South Africa,
\index{South Africa} expenditure on fruits and vegetables accounted
for about 12--14 percent of total food expenditure in each expenditure
decile. In India, fruits and vegetables accounted for about 17 percent
of total food expenditure in each fractile class in both rural and
urban areas.

It is arguable that the lack of a positive relationship between the
share of expenditure on fruits and vegetables with economic status in
low- and middle-income countries is because the unit cost of calories
from fruits and vegetables is considerably higher than the cost of
calories from even animal-source foods. As a result, in low- and
middle-income countries, although the absolute intake of fruits and
vegetables rises with economic conditions, even households with
relatively higher economic status cannot afford to adequately
substitute the intake of calorie-rich food with greater intake of
fruits and vegetables. As a result, the share of food expenditure for
fruits and vegetables remains very low for all economic classes.

\index{diet quality!relationship with economic status|)}

*** Other determinants of diet quality

\index{diet quality!importance of nutrition education and|(}

Diets and consumption patterns are also affected by non-economic
factors, including the social and cultural context, health and dietary
awareness among consumers, as well as the influence of
advertising. Although there is a positive relationship between
economic status and quality of diet, inadequate consumption of
nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables and dietary imbalances are
found among high-income consumers as well. Energy-dense foods are rich
in fats and sugars, which make the food more palatable, and results in
lack of satiation and satiety as their consumption is reduced
parencite:drewnoski1998. This in turn results in a considerable degree
of resistance to the substitution of energy-dense food despite
consumer awareness, and even when more nutritious foods are available
and affordable. \index{diet quality!influence of food advertising on}
Systematic reviews of evidence find that food advertisements primarily
focus on energy-dense food high in fat, salt, and sugar, and that such
food advertising has a strong influence on diets, particularly of
children parencite:cairns2009extent,hastings2006extent. It is now
widely recognized that improving dietary choices requires combining
nutrition education and public information campaigns with regulation
of exposure of children to unhealthy food advertisements. In view of
the harmful effects of food advertising on the diets of children, the
Sixty-third World Health Assembly endorsed a set of recommendations
for member-states to regulate marketing of foods and non-alcoholic
beverages to children.[fn:9]

\index{diet quality!importance of nutrition education and|)}

*** Key messages

Improving economic and physical access to nutritious foods that have
low energy density and are rich in nutrients is critical for
alleviating malnutrition.

This requires that all rural and urban households have sufficient
incomes not only to be able to access adequate quantities of
foodgrains, but also nutritious diets. Rural households need access to
land and other productive resources to support their livelihood, and
to produce adequate and nutritious food, not just to feed themselves
but other consumers as well.

It is also important that food price volatility is kept under control,
and that food prices remain affordable and food production
remunerative.

** Sustainability of food systems

\index{sustainable food systems|(}

Much food output augmentation in the past has put increasing stress on
natural resources -- degrading the soil, polluting and exhausting
fresh-water supplies, encroaching on forests, depleting wild fish
stocks, and reducing biodiversity. More intensive farming systems and
continued deforestation for agriculture and other land uses have also
become major sources of greenhouse gas emission, particularly in
industrialized countries. Harvest and post-harvest food losses,
particularly in developing countries, as well as high food wastage at
the end of the food chain, particularly in middle- and high-income
countries, reduce food availability parencite:faofoodloss2011.

While our approach to food production has become unsustainable, we
have the means to transform our production systems and consumption
patterns to create better food systems, to ensure healthier people.
citet:fao2014sustainable provides a conceptual framework for the
development of sustainable food systems, based on the following key
principles.

1. Improving efficiency in the use of resources is crucial to
   sustainable agriculture.

2. Sustainability requires direct actions to conserve, protect, and
   enhance natural resources.

3. Agriculture that fails to protect and improve rural livelihoods,
   equity, and social well-being is unsustainable.

4. Enhanced resilience of people, communities, and ecosystems is key
   to sustainable agriculture.

5. Sustainable food and agriculture requires responsible and effective
   governance mechanisms.

Creating more resilient food systems that take into account the
special needs of the more vulnerable is the most practical,
cost-efficient, and sustainable way to address all forms of
malnutrition. We need to produce nutritious food for all people today,
while also protecting the capacity of future generations to feed
themselves. Nutrition must become one of the primary objectives of
food-system policies and interventions, ensuring access to an
adequate, diverse, and balanced combination of dietary energy and
nutrients.

At every stage along the way, resources must be used more efficiently
and with less adverse impacts. Getting more and better food from
water, land, fertilizer, and labour can save resources and make food
systems more sustainable. An additional challenge is to manage
livestock production (in particular, large, industrial-scale)
sustainably, since it contributes more to greenhouse gases, resource
consumption, disease transmission, and health problems due to
excessive meat consumption.

Consumption of meat, milk, and eggs is growing rapidly in developing
countries, providing nutritious diets to previously food-insecure
populations. The livestock sector also improves livelihoods and
contributes to economic growth and rural incomes. We must manage this
sector sustainably, fostering a balanced, participatory, and
consultative process among key stakeholders.

\index{sustainable food systems|)}

** Supporting smallholder agriculture to make it more nutrition-sensitive

\index{smallholder agriculture|(}

\index{nutrition-sensitive agriculture|(}

There is increasing recognition that agriculture must be more
“nutrition-sensitive”, with agricultural policies and practices
supporting and facilitating more healthy -- nutritionally adequate and
diverse -- diets.

Improving the productivity of small-scale farms while promoting
diversification and more sustainable practices can reduce rural
malnutrition by improving the local availability and nutritional
quality of food, as well as by raising incomes and access to better
food. This typically requires investments in public goods, including
physical and social infrastructure, public support for agricultural
research and extension, and ensuring that agricultural production,
particularly by smallholder producers, remains profitable. Improving
access to land, finance, productive assets, technology, input and
output markets, as well as other supportive measures generally
enhances small producers’ productivity, income, spending, and
nutrition.

To make agriculture more nutrition-sensitive, attention must be paid
to supporting mixed farming systems, protecting on-farm biodiversity,
and promoting production of nutritious but underutilized crops
parencite:mayes2011. Agricultural research and development must focus
more intensely on nutrient-dense foods, such as millets, legumes, fruits,
vegetables, and animal-source foods, as well as on local biodiversity
and diversified farming systems. Research to develop new varieties and
to increase the yields of many of these nutrient-dense crops has not
been prioritized historically. It is essential to correct this
imbalance in agricultural research.

Making agriculture nutrition-sensitive is essential for a sustainable
approach to addressing micronutrient deficiencies, and represents both
a challenge and an important economic opportunity for agriculture.

:END:

\chaptermark{Social Protection}


\index{social protection|(}

Experience shows that some initiatives for eradicating hunger and
malnutrition require special efforts by national governments in order
to accelerate progress. Social protection is clearly one such area.

\index{social protection!social protection floor|(}

Social protection can ensure access to a minimum level of resources so
that people can have decent conditions of work and life. In recent
years, discussions on social protection have moved towards the idea of
providing a social protection floor, which refers to a set of
nationally determined basic social security guarantees for
everyone. The General Conference of the International Labour
Organization (ILO) adopted the Social Protection Floors Recommendation
in 2012, which identified four sets of basic guarantees that any
national social protection floor should include: (a) access to
essential health care; (b) income security for children, ensuring
access to adequate nutrition, education, and care; (c) basic income
security for persons of active working age unable to earn a sufficient
income; and (d) basic income security for older persons.

\index{social protection!Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food|(}

Guarantee against food insecurity and malnutrition is thus a crucial
component of a social protection floor. In this context, discussions
on the Right to Food and implementation of FAO's Voluntary Guidelines
to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food
in the Context of National Food Security are central
parencite:ajemian2014,vgrtffao,deschutter2014.

\index{social protection!Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food|)}

\index{social protection!social protection floor|)}

Social protection is provided in various forms. These include cash or
in-kind transfer payments, subsidized provision of goods and services,
insurance, and guarantee of wages and employment.  Although there are
variations in the efficacy of different types of programmes depending
on the socio-economic context, in-kind transfer programmes,
particularly when designed to meet minimum nutritional requirements of
the target population, are an effective instrument for ending food
insecurity and raising nutritional status. Cash transfer programmes,
with substantial benefits and broad coverage, can also provide
complementary resources in the hands of households to buy food and to
invest in food production.

** Why is social protection important for food security {{{NEWLINE}}} and nutrition?
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Why is social protection important for food security and nutrition?
:END:

A system of social protection not only protects the vulnerable against
economic and environmental shocks, but also ensures that everyone has
enough resources to be able to acquire adequate nutritious
food. Social protection can significantly reduce income poverty in
rural areas. Complementary social protection programmes can target
specific nutritional deficiencies and vulnerable population
groups. These include children, pregnant and lactating mothers, older
persons, and persons belonging to disadvantaged social or occupational
groups.

Social protection programmes also have positive spill-over effects
such as by creating upward pressure on wages, enhancing small
producers’ accumulation of productive resources, and increasing
productivity, infrastructural development, and augmenting demand. A
significant impact of social protection is improving access of poor
producers to investible resources. FAO's /From Protection to
Production/ studies
#+index: social protection!From Protection to Production (PtoP)
have shown that social protection programmes can significantly boost
agricultural as well as non-agricultural production (Box
[[box-ptop]]). Over time, a well-functioning social protection system can
significantly support rural livelihoods and help improve the
nutritional status of the population at large.

Social protection for the poor also helps augment demand, which in
turn can have very substantial multiplier effects on domestic
production and national income. The impact of social protection on
demand can be crucial in times of economic crises. This was witnessed
in many countries during the post-2008 financial crisis. Discussing
the role of social protection during the financial crisis, a report of
the Social Protection Floor Advisory Group
parencite:bachelet2012social concluded: "Recent years have provided
potent proof of the value of social protection interventions in a time
of crisis. Throughout the economic and financial crisis many
floor-type social protection measures acted as effective
counter-cyclical stabilizers. They helped attenuate the adverse impact
on labour markets, contributed to maintaining social cohesion and
stimulated aggregate demand. The combined effect of this effort
ultimately aided and spurred economic recovery in a range of
countries."

\index{social protection!public expenditure on|(} Public expenditure
for social protection varies considerably across countries according
to the extent of coverage and the level of social protection
provided. While it is desirable that countries progressively expand
the coverage and extent of social protection, and increase public
expenditure on social protection to facilitate that, it has been
pointed out that the extent of social protection benefits can be
substantial even with relatively modest fiscal outlays. The ILO has
estimated that 6 percent of global GDP is required to provide basic
social security cover to all those without access to social
security. It has been argued that this should be possible by primarily
using national resources parencite:ILO2008. Three-quarters of the
world’s poorest people live in rural areas, and many are themselves
producers of food. Historically, social protection has emerged in
urban areas, primarily for wage employees, military veterans, and the
unemployed. Extending social protection to the countryside requires a
major reorientation and reorganization of social protection. It is
also important to orient social protection to enhance the productive
and income-generating capacities and capabilities of the
beneficiaries. \index{social protection!public expenditure on|)}

** Provision of food through social protection programmes

\index{social protection!direct provision of food|(} Direct
provisioning of food is done through various kinds of social
protection programmes. These include food assistance programmes,
programmes that provide subsidized food, school-meal programmes and
other programmes where cooked food is provided to particularly
vulnerable sections of the population, and food-for-work
programmes. Food provisioning programmes have historically been an
important part of the food security policies of many
countries. Programmes for provision of free or subsidized food were
used in many developing countries during much of the twentieth
century. The use of food-for-work programmes to create demand as well
as build public infrastructure also has a very long history.

*** Trends in food provisioning programmes

\startsquarepar

#+INDEX: World Trade Organization (WTO) |(
Over the last few decades, many countries have discontinued large food
provisioning programmes and shifted to other forms of social
protection. There were three primary drivers of this change. First,
international finance institutions, donors, and other advocates of
fiscal conservatism criticized food subsidy programmes for being
expensive. Food provisioning programmes in various countries were
targets of reform under structural adjustment programmes implemented
across the developing world. Secondly, since the early 1990s, global
food aid has declined considerably parencite:barrettmaxwell2005 and
many international donors have shifted to supporting cash transfer
\index{social protection!impact of structural adjustment on}
programmes. While food aid declined and domestic production in
developing countries grew slowly, food-deficit countries have had to
rely on food imports. Globally, between 1980 and 2010, imports
increased by 67 percent for wheat, 166 percent for rice, and 36
percent for maize. Thirdly, under the World Trade Organization's
Uruguay Round agreement, procurement and stockholding of agricultural

The FAO's /From Protection to Production/ project has systematically
evaluated the impact of social protection programmes on
income-generating activities and consumption in seven countries in
Sub-Saharan Africa. All the programmes studied by the project are cash
transfer programmes, targeting poor households.  While transfers in
some programmes under evaluation were unconditional, in other
programmes, beneficiaries had to satisfy pre-specified conditions to
be entitled to the transfers.

\index{Local Economy-Wide Impact Evaluation (LEWIE)|(}

The project has developed a methodology called Local Economy-Wide
Impact Evaluation (LEWIE) to assess the impact of these programmes on
local economies. LEWIE uses local-level social accounting matrices for
treatment and control households, created using household-,
enterprise- and community-level survey data
parencite:asfaw2012analytical.

\index{Local Economy-Wide Impact Evaluation (LEWIE)|)}

The studies estimated that incomes generated on account of the cash
transfer programmes were 1.27 to 2.52 times the amount of cash
transferred (Table \ref{ptop-income-multiplier}). The programmes
accounted for 7 percent (Ghana) \index{Ghana} to 30 percent

\noindent products through domestic price support programmes were
classified as trade-distorting and severely restricted. Consequently,
many developing countries switched from programmes providing
subsidized food to other forms of assistance.
#+INDEX: World Trade Organization (WTO) |)

Given pressures to reduce the fiscal burden of social protection
programmes, the shifts away from food provisioning programmes to other
forms of social protection have also been associated with the
narrowing of social protection.

Among developing countries, programmes for provision of subsidized
food are now limited to a few large countries that are able to
fiscally sustain their domestic procurement and distribution
programmes.  Of all the major ongoing food subsidy programmes, India's
Public Distribution System (PDS)
#+index: India!public distribution system
is arguably the largest. It provides subsidized grain to over 40
percent of Indian households. This was expected to be raised to
two-thirds of the population under the National Food Security Act,
2013 (Box [[india-public-distribution]]).

Another major food subsidy programme, Indonesia's Operasi Pasar Khusus
Rice Subsidy Programme, was introduced in 1998. Under this programme,
\index{Indonesia!Operasi Pasar Khusus (Rice Subsidy Programme)}
beneficiary households are entitled to get 10 kilograms of rice every
month at a subsidized price parencite:tabor2001social. The programme,
\index{Indonesia!Rice for the Poor (Raskin)} now called Rice for the
Poor (Raskin), covers about 17 million households. It has been
estimated that Raskin has reduced the probability of being poor among
beneficiary households by about 4 percent
parencite:sumarto2005assessing. Raskin has not only increased rice
consumption among beneficiaries, but also allowed them to consume
greater quantities of other nutritious food items including meat,
fish, and dairy products parencite:pangaribowo2012food.

\index{India!public distribution system (PDS)|(}

#+NAME: india-public-distribution
#+attr_latex: :options [Public Distribution System in India]
#+begin_infobox

Public distribution of foodgrains in India dates back to the inter-war
period. The statutory wheat price was fixed for the first time
in 1941. Much emphasis was put on producing more rice because of the
decline in the supply of rice from Burma, which had been occupied by
Japan. Before the 1960s, food distribution was based on imported food
or food received in aid. By the 1970s, India became self-sufficient in
the production of foodgrains and the Public Distribution System (PDS)
evolved into a universal scheme for the distribution of subsidized
food through a network of ration shops. Since the 1970s, the system of
public procurement and the Public Distribution System (PDS) have
functioned in tandem. A system of minimum support prices is used to
provide incentives to farmers and to procure grain, which is then
provided to consumers at subsidized prices under the PDS.

After India introduced structural adjustment programmes in the early
1990s, the principle of universal minimum entitlement was abandoned
and coverage of the PDS progressively reduced
citep:swaminathan2000weakening. In June 1992, geographical targeting
was introduced under the Revamped PDS, with beneficiaries in specified
backward and inaccessible blocks across the country being given higher
grain entitlements than beneficiaries in the rest of the country. In
1997, different entitlements were introduced for households identified
as below the poverty line (BPL) and for others, under the Targeted
Public Distribution System (TPDS). Two changes were introduced in the
PDS in 2000: first, the central government stopped subsidizing grain
provided to households not classified as poor; and secondly, the
central government introduced another category, of the poorest and
most vulnerable, who were given greater grain entitlements at highly
subsidized prices. On the other hand, with the introduction of
differentiated entitlements, targeting was progressively narrowed and
persons not identified as poor were excluded. It has been noted that
the TPDS targets subsidies very narrowly, and a large proportion of
food-insecure and vulnerable households are excluded from it.

The PDS is operated jointly by the central and State governments. The
central government has the responsibility for procurement, storage,
and provision of grains to the States. Using estimates of poverty, the
central government specifies the quotas of each State for obtaining
grain for different categories of beneficiaries. The States are
provided grain at the central issue prices specified for each category
of beneficiary. The State governments are responsible for the
identification of the different target groups and the distribution of
grain to them through a network of fair price shops. Given high food
inflation around the end of the 2000s and large-scale exclusion of the
poor from the TPDS, many State governments introduced additional
subsidies and entitlements for different categories of beneficiaries
in recent years. For example, Tamil Nadu re-introduced universal
coverage of the PDS in 2006. In 2011, Chhattisgarh expanded the PDS
under a State-level Food Security Act to provide subsidized grain to
90 percent of the population. While the introduction of narrow
targeting has resulted in substantial exclusion of the poor and
increased leakages from the programme, the expansion of its coverage
in many States and the modernization of supply-chain management since
the late 2000s have contributed to a very significant decline in
leakages from the PDS, contributing to its remarkable revival
parencite:khera2011revival,drezekherapds2015,khera2011diversion,krishnamurthy2014impacts. Revival
of the PDS has been associated with an increased proportion of
households buying grain through PDS, rising from only 22 percent in
2004--05 to about 45 percent in 2011--12 parencite:senhimanshu2013a.

As part of a larger move towards rights-based entitlements, the
central government introduced the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in
2013 to revamp the TPDS citep:jayatifao2014,sinha2013cost. Under the
NFSA, 75 percent of the rural population and half of the urban
population are entitled to subsidized grain. The NFSA promises to
provide 5 kilograms of grain per person per month at subsidized prices
to beneficiary households. An important feature of the NFSA is that it
expanded the basket of grains to include millets and pulses, in
addition to rice and wheat traditionally provided under the PDS. This
is expected to have significant positive implications for nutritional
outcomes. The NFSA also has specific provisions for nutritional
support to \index{women} pregnant and lactating women, as well as
children.

India spends only about 1.2 percent of its GDP on the Public
Distribution System citep:jayatifao2014. With a network of more than
462,000 fair price shops distributing grain annually to about 180
million households, India's PDS is the largest food distribution
programme of its kind in the world. It also has been the most
important instrument of India's public policy against poverty and
undernourishment. According to large-scale survey data for 2009--10,
the PDS was responsible for lifting 38 million people out of poverty
in 2009--10 parencite:senhimanshu2013a,drezekhera2013. When fully
implemented, the National Food Security Act is expected to further
strengthen the PDS in dealing with food insecurity and malnutrition.

\index{Brazil!Programa de Aquisição de Alimentos (PAA)|(}

Brazil's food acquisition programme, Programa de Aquisição de
Alimentos (PAA), is remarkable in many respects. The PAA, started in
2003 as part of the Fome Zero Programme, reorganized and expanded the
earlier system of price support to farmers. Through the PAA, price
support was extended to resource-poor family farmers. Figure [[brazilpaa]]
shows the large increase in number of beneficiaries and public
expenditure on PAA between 2003 and 2012. The unique feature of the
programme was that, besides procurement of central food stocks for
price stabilization and food security, it also created marketing
channels for local procurement of food through farmers' organizations
and local networks for sale to locally food-insecure
populations. Specific initiatives were taken to create opportunities
for farmers to produce and sell vegetables, native fruits, grains,
nuts, milk, and other nutritious food items. Food items procured from
family farmers through the PAA were supplied to food-insecure
households as well as to schools for their meal programmes
citep:da2011fome,peraci2011,swensson2015brazil,soares2013paapnae. Many
assessments have shown that these initiatives have significantly
improved the dietary diversity of both family farmers and
food-insecure consumers (for reviews, see
citealp:catia2013,soares2013paapnae).

*** Food assistance in emergencies

While many countries have discontinued general food provisioning
programmes, it is common to use food provisioning to deal with
disruption in food supplies because of disasters, emergencies and
economic and humanitarian crises. For example, food assistance and
food subsidies were relied upon by many countries to deal with the
2008 food price crisis. According to FAO's Global Information and
Early Warning System for Food and Agriculture (GIEWS) database, five
countries in Africa, five in Asia, and six in Latin America and the
Caribbean instituted policy changes in favour of food subsidies/food
assistance programmes in response to rising prices.[fn:11] Of the ten
African countries covered by the Monitoring and Analysing Food and
Agricultural Policies (MAFAP) programme of FAO, six used distribution
of subsidized food as a measure to deal with food price rises in 2008
parencite:mafap2013.

*** School feeding programmes

\index{social protection!school feeding programmes|(}

In contrast with the decline of programmes to subsidize food, food
assistance in the form of school-meal programmes is being used more
widely across countries (Figure [[schoolfood-map]]). A World Food
Programme \index{World Food Programme} report estimated that 368
million children the world over are fed in schools daily
parencite:schoolfood2013. India's Mid-day Meal Scheme is the largest
school feeding programme in the world, feeding over 100 million
children daily. \index{India!Mid-day Meal Scheme}

\index{Brazil!Programa Nacional de Alimentação Escolar (PNAE)|(}

Brazil's school feeding programme, Programa Nacional de Alimentação
Escolar (PNAE), feeds over 45 million children daily. The PNAE, which
was started in 1954, saw a major expansion after its integration into
the Fome Zero programme in 2003 (Figure [[brazilpnae]]). The PNAE is
particularly \index{Brazil!Fome Zero} noteworthy for the efforts taken
to improve the nutritional quality of meals served. With its linkages
to the Food Acquisition Programme (PAA), the PNAE has substantially
increased inclusion of locally sourced fruits and vegetables in school
meals. As a result, the proportion of schools in Brazil serving fruits
in school meals increased from 28 percent in 2004 to 62 percent
in 2006. Similarly, the proportion of schools serving fresh vegetables
in school meals increased from 57 percent in 2004 to 80 percent in
2006, and to 90 percent in 2010 citep:sidaner2013brazilian.

provide free fruit to children in schools. The scheme provides free
fruit to over 8 million children in the EU. The EU covers 50--75
percent of the cost of fruit, with the rest borne by participating
countries. In 2014, the EU merged its School Milk Scheme and its
School Fruit Scheme into a single scheme citep:whoeuprices2015.

*** Expanding the provision of food

Food subsidy and food assistance programmes are important instruments
of social protection for improving access to food for the
food-insecure and vulnerable. Such programmes directly result in
increased food consumption, and thus have a direct impact on
undernourishment and malnutrition.

\index{social protection!food for work} Food-for-work programmes not
only provide direct income support to manual wage earners, who are
typically among the poorest sections in a country's population, but
can also have an indirect effect on incomes by raising wage levels in
labour markets. Food-for-work programmes can also make a significant
contribution towards building public infrastructure. School-meal
programmes have been shown to have a very positive impact on school
enrolment as well as on the nutritional status of
schoolchildren. School feeding programmes have also been used to
mitigate the impact of various kinds of crises
parencite:bundy2009rethinking.

Food provisioning programmes, if based on procurement of food
commodities from local farmers, can also support smallholder
agriculture, promote production of more nutritious and less
resource-intensive crops, and induce more sustainable land use. The
2013 /State of School Feeding Report/ showed that, like all other food
provisioning programmes, school feeding can help create demand for
domestic agriculture. Local procurement of food not only helps
increase demand for agriculture, but also facilitates the provision of
diverse, nutritious, and unprocessed food to children
parencite:schoolfood2013.

Food provisioning programmes based on domestic procurement of food can
be designed to reduce the exposure of producers to price fluctuations
and to ensure that they get decent remuneration through prices. Food
provisioning programmes can also be used to induce dietary changes in
favour of more nutritious food items.

A major advantage of entitlements specified in terms of food is that,
unlike cash entitlements, food entitlements are automatically
protected against food price inflation. This can be extremely
important in times of high food-price inflation, which typically
increases food insecurity.

It may also be pointed that food provisioning programmes, in general,
have been popular among beneficiaries wherever they have been
introduced in developing countries. Many studies from across different
countries in Asia and Africa have reported preference of beneficiaries
for in-kind provision (or a combination of cash and in-kind
entitlements) over cash entitlements
citep:sabates2010,ahmed2009comparing,sofi2012,khera2011revival,hoddinott2013impact,jayati2011cash.

\index{World Trade Organization (WTO)|(}

Although food provisioning programmes have many advantages over other
forms of social protection by ensuring access to adequate and
nutritious food, the capacity of governments to run large-scale food
distribution programme is limited by the World Trade Organization's
Uruguay Round agreement.  Public procurement of food from farmers
through price support programmes is considered trade-distorting and
classified in the Amber Box in WTO's current rules. Under these rules,
the difference between prices offered to farmers under a public
procurement programme and prices prevailing in 1986--88 is multiplied
by the total output potentially eligible for support (not the actual
quantity procured), to calculate the level of price support provided
by a country. The price support thus computed is considered part of
Amber Box subsidies, subject to restrictions on the Aggregate Measure
of Support.

Over time, as world food prices have increased to levels far higher
than the prices prevailing in 1986--88, the WTO restrictions on price
support and public stockholdings have stifled food distribution
programmes.\index{food prices!global} On the other hand, these
restrictions have done little to reduce the vast disparities between
levels of support to agriculture provided by developed and developing
countries. Despite restrictions imposed under the agreement, most
developed countries have retained high levels of support for
agriculture by shifting most of their subsidies to the unlimited
“Green Box” of forms of support, not restricted by the Agreement on
Agriculture. Green Box subsidies in developed countries, although not
directly linked to levels of production, have helped farmers to
innovate, invest, and increase productivity by providing additional
resources for investment and by effectively reducing risks associated
with investment. Such support has also extended social protection to
the countryside. On the other hand, lacking comparable levels of
support, cultivation by small producers in developing countries has
become even less viable and uncompetitive. The WTO does not restrict
Green Box-types of support to agriculture. However, administrative and
other constraints limit the possibility and feasibility of developing
countries using Green Box subsidies. The WTO provisions for policy
instruments such as crop insurance to be counted in the Green Box are
extremely restrictive. Green Box measures, such as decoupled payments
-- lump cash transfers to farmers -- are not feasible in most
developing countries because of domestic governance bottlenecks such
as the absence of data, a lack of well-defined land titles, informal
markets, frequent market failures, and insufficient rural financial
facilities.

Restrictions on developing countries that provide support to
smallholder producers and subsidized food to food-insecure consumers
became the centre of a WTO dispute at the Bali Ministerial
in 2013. India, which had just passed a National Food Security Act
entitling two-thirds of its population to 5 kilograms of subsidized
grains per capita per month through its food distribution programme,
demanded relaxation of restrictions on such domestic price support
programmes. The Bali agreement exempted existing programmes for
stockholdings of traditional staple crops until a permanent solution
to the dispute could be found. However, introduction of new food
distribution programmes, expansion of existing programmes, and
inclusion of nutritious non-staple foods in food distribution
programmes continue to be subject to the Aggregate Measure of Support
restrictions.

It is important that the global trade agreements are revised to remove
disparities in permissible agricultural support levels between
developed and developing countries, modify archaic clauses in the
rules that govern global trade, and provide exemptions from
restrictions on procurement programmes meant for domestic food
security and support to poor producers. These rules have severely
limited the potential of national governments to run food distribution
programmes for the purpose of domestic food security.

** Cash transfer programmes

\index{social protection!cash transfer programmes|(}

Following the decline in food provisioning programmes over the last
few decades and the recent promotion of cash transfer programmes, the
latter have become the most widely used instrument for social
protection in developing countries. Many countries, particularly in
Latin America and the Caribbean, have established large-scale cash
transfer programmes. Some of these have had remarkable outcomes in
reducing the prevalence of poverty and food insecurity, though not
necessarily malnutrition. Cash transfer programmes can be either
conditional, when they require beneficiaries to satisfy certain
conditions like sending children to school, or unconditional, where a
basic transfer is ensured for all.


*** Cash transfer programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean


#+index: Latin America and the Caribbean!cash transfer programmes|(

Large-scale use of conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes started
in Latin America in the late 1990s
parencite:cecchini2011conditional. By the end of the first decade of
the twenty-first century, CCTs were used in almost all countries of
Latin America and the Caribbean, covering about 19 percent of the
region's population (Table [[cct-latin-america]]). Spending on CCTs was
about 0.4 percent of total GDP of all countries in the region. The
most well-known and biggest CCT programme, Bolsa Familia in Brazil,
\index{Brazil!Bolsa Familia} started with a coverage of about 3.6
million families in 2003, when various social protection programmes in
the country were merged to form the programme. By 2013, Bolsa Familia
covered 13.9 million families. Mexico ended decades-old corn-tortilla
subsidies and shifted to the Progresa-Oportunidades
\index{Mexico!Oportunidades} conditional cash transfer programme in
the late 1990s. Starting with about 1.6 million families, the coverage
of Progresa-Oportunidades expanded to about 5.8 million families by
2012.[fn:12] In terms of coverage of national populations, Ecuador's

percent.

*** Cash transfer programmes in Africa

\index{Africa!cash transfer programmes|(}

While Latin American countries have been able to implement large-scale
cash transfer programmes primarily with domestic resources, growth has
been sporadic and slow in Africa. Social protection in Africa has been
heavily dependent on aid and used primarily to deal with emergencies
akin to `social safety net' programmes. The decline in the
availability of food aid has weakened social protection systems in
Africa and encouraged countries to shift to donor-funded cash transfer
programmes. Although a few middle-income countries have been able to
sustain cash transfer programmes albeit with heavy donor support, in
most African countries, cash transfer programmes have been implemented
as pilot projects or as small, short-term projects to deal with
emergencies. citet:kakwani2005cct argue that owing to budgetary
constraints, most cash transfer schemes in Africa set benefits at such
low levels that they have very little impact on poverty.

\index{Africa!cash transfer programmes|)}

*** Food stamps/coupons

\index{social protection!food coupons|(}

Food stamps/coupons are essentially cash transfers only meant for food
purchase. In a typical food coupon programme, beneficiaries are
entitled to food coupons worth a specified amount of money every
month, which they can use to buy food from approved retailers. Food
retailers can then exchange these food coupons for money.

The longest running food stamps programme is the Food Stamps Programme
in the United States, started by the Food Stamps Act of 1977 and
\index{United States!Food Stamps Act} renamed as the Supplementary
Nutritional Assistance Programme in 2008, which covers, according to
statistics for 2014--15, over 46 million Americans. By contrast, food
\index{United States!Supplementary Nutritional Assistance Programme}
coupons have not been very popular among developing countries
citep:josling2011global. Most countries that have introduced food
coupons have done so mainly to reduce the fiscal burden of food
subsidies through narrow targeting. Several countries in Latin America
and the Caribbean experimented with food coupons in the late 1970s and
early 1980s, before abandoning them in favour of CCT
programmes.\index{Latin America and the Caribbean}

Since no producer subsidies are involved, food coupon programmes are
not considered trade-distorting under the WTO's Uruguay Round
Agreement on Agriculture.\index{World Trade Organization (WTO)}

\index{social protection!food coupons|)}

*** Nutritional impact and limitations of cash transfer programmes

In countries that have implemented large cash transfer programmes --
providing substantial transfers and covering most of their vulnerable
population -- these programmes have increased expenditure on food as
well as other essentials.  citet:manley2013effective provide a
detailed review of a large number of evaluations of various cash
transfer programmes. The general finding of most studies is that
programmes that involve substantial transfers result in higher food
consumption and improved dietary quality. Beneficiary households
consume more fruit, vegetables, and animal-source foods than
households with similar economic status who are not covered by cash
transfer programmes. Expenditure on food accounts for the bulk of the
money provided by cash transfer programmes in developing
countries. Cash transfer programmes that provide substantial transfers
and are accompanied by other interventions providing access to
nutritionally rich food items are associated with improved nutritional
outcomes. Food coupons, when substantial in their real value, have
been found to significantly contribute to improving dietary diversity
citep:Hidrobo2014144. On the other hand, when the real value of
transfers is very small, benefits in terms of increased consumption
and improved nutritional outcomes are not significant.

\index{social protection!impact of inflation on|(}

In comparison with programmes that entitle beneficiaries to a certain
amount of food, an important limitation of cash transfer programmes is
that the entitlements for beneficiaries are not protected against
inflation. Very few cash transfers have entitlements indexed to
inflation. There are many examples in low-income countries where cash
transfer and food stamps programmes became insignificant because of
depreciation of the real value of transfers, and the unwillingness of
governments and donors to index entitlements against inflation.

Rapid devaluation in the value of food stamps because of food price
inflation is the most serious problem that food stamp programmes in
developing countries have faced citep:swaminathanfoodstamps. Sri
Lanka, where the food stamps programme started in 1978, is one of the
few developing countries that continues to have a food stamps
programme. However, as shown by citet:edirisinghe1987food, the real
value of food stamps in Sri Lanka fell to about half their original
value within three years of introduction. A careful assessment of the
shift from a universal food subsidy scheme to food stamps in Sri Lanka
by citet:anandkanbur1991 found that "the burden of real cuts in the
food subsidy budget is likely to have fallen disproportionately on the
poor". With the low value of transfers involved, food stamps in Sri
Lanka have not had any significant impact on nutritional outcomes. In
Jamaica, another country where a food stamps programme has been
implemented for a long time, devaluation of the real value of food
stamps has marginalized the significance of the programme.

citet:sabates2010 reviewed the impact of food price crisis on the real
value of cash entitlements under the Productive Safety Net Programme
(PSNP) in Ethiopia. Under different conditions, participating
households under the PSNP are provided food or cash, employment in
public works, as well as other specified goods and services. They show
that the real value of cash transfers in terms of staple cereals
varied considerably across districts and seasons because of variations
in prices; the real value of cash transfers in terms of staple cereals
had eroded to less than half within just four years since the
inception of the PSNP.

citet:sabates2010 highlight that not only has the real value of cash
transfers diminished because of food price inflation, in places where
food supply is constrained and entirely dependent on unregulated
private traders, cash transfer itself can exacerbate inflation. This
in turn further diminishes purchasing power and particularly adversely
affects vulnerable households that are excluded from the cash transfer
programmes. citet:cunha2011price studied the inflationary impact of
cash and food provisioning using data from beneficiaries of the
Mexican \index{Mexico!Programa de Apoyo Alimentario} Programa de Apoyo
Alimentario (PAL), which allows beneficiaries to choose between cash
and in-kind transfers. In half of the villages studied, poor
households were directly provided food through the PAL; in 25 percent
of the villages, beneficiary households were provided equivalent
amounts in cash; while in the remaining control villages, no transfers
were provided. The study found that food provisioning contributed to
bringing down inflation by increasing supply along with increasing
demand for food, while cash transfer programmes exacerbated
inflation. This difference alone accounted for an 11 percent
additional benefit from food provisioning against cash transfers.

\index{social protection!impact of inflation on|)}

Since beneficiaries of cash transfers/food coupons purchase food from
the market, governments are not required to procure, stock, and
distribute food. Cash transfers/food coupons can be used when
infrastructure for public procurement, supply-chain management, and
distribution does not exist for running food distribution
\index{social protection!food coupons} programmes. In countries where
food distribution programmes only provide staple grain, cash transfers
(in particular, food coupons) can be used as a complement to improve
access to perishable commodities like fruit, vegetables, and milk.

However, the flip side \index{social protection!food coupons} of this
aspect of cash transfers/food coupon programmes is that governments do
not intervene on the supply-side to ensure that adequate food is
available to meet the demands of the programmes. Without such an
intervention, the impact of a
#+index: social protection!food coupons
food coupon/cash transfer programme on production is mediated by the
market, and may not be optimal for long-term food security,
nutritional outcomes or sustainability. Besides, as discussed already,
imperfections in the functioning of markets and supply-side
bottlenecks can create serious inflationary imbalances.

It is widely recognized that the use of conditionalities requires
considerable supply side investments to ensure availability of
services upon which provision of cash is made conditional
citep:jayati2011cash,fernald2013promise. Some conditional cash
transfers have been criticized for large-scale exclusion of
particularly vulnerable sections of the population because of their
inability to meet conditions parencite:garcia2012cash. Also, the cost
of imposing and monitoring conditionalities can be high, and may
outweigh the benefits of imposing them. In Sub-Saharan Africa, most
cash transfer programmes are either unconditional or have soft
conditionalities not requiring mandatory compliance as supply
constraints and the inability of many beneficiaries to comply with the
conditionalities could result in large-scale exclusion of many of the
poorest and most vulnerable citep:garcia2012cash. In Mexico, the
Programa de Apoyo Alimentario (PAL) was started in 2003 to provide
support to \index{Mexico!Programa de Apoyo Alimentario} communities
whose households are unable to participate in Oportunidades
\index{Mexico|Oportunidades} because of absence of a school or health
clinic nearby. Conditionalities under the PAL are softer than in
Oportunidades, and are not strictly enforced.

There can also be considerable leakage and fraud in cash transfer
programmes; preventing them usually entails considerable monitoring
costs. Where penetration of formal financial systems is low,
regulatory systems are weak, and corruption in the public services is
serious, cash distribution can create significant opportunities for
fraud at different stages of programme
implementation. citet:ellis2009social have documented various kinds of
problems in targeting social protection programmes in Africa. For
example, in Lesotho's Old Age Pension programme, `ghost beneficiaries'
\index{Lesotho!Old Age Pension programme} were created to secure
benefits. In various programmes in many countries, headmen, officials,
and other powerful people have cornered substantial benefits. The
experience with cash transfers in India's Integrated Rural Development
\index{India!Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP)} Programme
(IRDP) in the 1980s was similar. Given the attractiveness of cash
hand-outs, implementation of the programme was marred by elite
capture, leakages, and corruption (see, among others,
citealp:dreze1990irdp,kripa1991irdp,rath1985irdp,guhan1980poverty). In
India, recent programmes involving cash payments have also faced the
problem of significant leakages (see, for example,
citealp:usami2012some,shankargaihanrega,mgnregasameeksha2012).

\index{social protection!cash transfer programmes|)}

** Dealing with under-5 child and maternal nutrition deficiencies

\index{women|(}

\index{child malnutrition|(}

\index{stunting}

It is now well recognized that preventing stunting and other forms of
severe undernutrition requires special attention to nutrition
deficiencies afflicting mothers and children under 5 years of
age. Recent studies suggest that the first thousand days from
conception until reaching the age of 2 are the most important for
long-term human development. Inadequate nutrition during this period
is the most important cause of long-term undernutrition. Securing
improvements in the nutrition of pregnant and lactating women, infants
and young children requires that specific nutrition programmes be
linked with general social protection programmes, as well as
programmes for improving access to safe water, sanitation, and
health care.

Access to nutritious food for mothers and children under 5 can be
improved by community child-care facilities as well as other social
protection policies. Statistical evidence from various conditional
cash transfer programmes in Latin America shows significant
improvements in the nutritional status of infants and young children
when social protection programmes are linked with nutritional
programmes. For example, evaluations of Mexico’s Oportunidades show an
\index{Mexico!Oportunidades} increase of about 1 cm in height among
children from beneficiary households compared to controls, and an
increase of 0.13 kg in birth weight among children born in beneficiary
households compared to controls. Various studies have found
improvements in the Z-scores of height-for-age of children from
beneficiary households of various social protection programmes, in
comparison with controls citep:who2013essential. Improvements in the
access of pregnant women from beneficiary households to antenatal care
have also been noted citep:sowc2009.

\index{stunting}

The WHO's \index{World Health Organization (WHO)} comparison of improvements
in child nutrition in different programmes across the world with the
programme intensity -- measured in terms of the number of community
health and nutrition workers (CHNWs) deployed -- found that the extent
of contact between trained community workers and mothers with children
is crucial. Programmes with more than 30 CHNWs per 1,000 children
achieved 1--2 percentage points per year reduction in prevalence of
underweight. However, owing to considerable variation in the way
resources are used, no clear relationship could be seen between the
amount of resources provided under nutrition programmes and outcomes
citep:who2013essential.

It is important to note that not all nutrition programmes have
significantly impacted maternal and child nutrition. For example,
studies of India's Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) have
found little or no impact on child undernutrition
citep:lokshin2005icds.

An important lesson to draw from the experience of implementing
nutrition programmes is that when nutrition programmes work in
isolation, without utilizing synergies with social protection
programmes and programmes for improving access to safe water,
sanitation, and health care, the impacts are limited. On the other
hand, synergies among various programmes ensure significant gains in
nutritional outcomes of infants and young children.

\index{child malnutrition|)}

\index{women|)}

** Coverage of social protection programmes

Social protection is most effective when designed to provide basic
universal coverage. Providing basic social protection coverage to
everyone is also important from a human rights-based
perspective. Universal social protection programmes need to be
combined with specific interventions targeted at
nutritionally vulnerable populations, such as children, as well as
pregnant and lactating women.

\index{social protection!impact of structural adjustment on|(}

The coverage of social security systems has been narrowed and public
spending on social security cut by the structural adjustment
programmes implemented in developing countries across the world from
the 1980s. As part of the conditions of these programmes, leading
international finance institutions argued to minimize social
provisioning. Instead, social safety nets, narrowly targeted at the
poorest and most vulnerable, were introduced from the 1990s for the
purpose of providing security against shocks
parencite:mkandawire2005targeting,holzmann2003social.

\index{social protection!impact of structural adjustment on|)}

\index{social protection!targeting|(}

It has long been recognized that means-tested targeting entails
considerable costs. citet:sen1995targeting argues that targeting
involves significant direct and indirect costs. Targeting subsidies
can affect economic behaviour, stigmatize beneficiaries, involve
considerable administrative costs, and be invasive by requiring
extensive disclosures to become eligible for benefits. He argues that
programmes targeted narrowly at the very poor are difficult to sustain
politically because the beneficiaries are likely to have limited
political clout. On the other hand, programmes that provide a
universal minimum entitlement are likely to find much greater
political support.

In a detailed review of targeting in social protection programmes,
citet:mkandawire2005targeting identifies three major problems. First,
given the limited capacity of governments in poor countries and the
predominance of informal economic relations, targeting based on
assessment of incomes and means is necessarily imprecise, involving
very high administrative costs, and inviting problems of corruption,
theft, and fraud.[fn:13] Other, more blunt forms of targeting involve
more likely errors of both wrongful exclusion and wrongful
inclusion. Given serious asymmetries of information, targeting
produced "perverse incentives" and was "an open invitation to rent
seeking and corruption". Secondly, targeting creates serious political
problems. These arise from overall reductions in budgets, the
stigmatizing effects of targeting, the invasiveness of measurement for
targeting purposes, and the compounding "paternalistic and
clientelistic practices of bureaucracies". Thirdly, targeting creates
a disincentive for beneficiaries to achieve outcomes that would
disqualify them from receiving benefits. citet:ellis2012cct argues
that, with the high prevalence of poverty and vulnerability, narrowly
targeted cash transfers that privilege a few of the many poor and
vulnerable are socially divisive.

It is common to assess targeting in terms of errors of wrongful
exclusion of the eligible (Type I errors) and wrongful inclusion of
those not eligible (Type II errors). One of the most detailed and
careful studies of errors in targeting by citet:cornia1993two
concluded that replacement of universal schemes by targeted schemes in
a number of countries has been associated with a major increase in
errors of wrongful exclusion, with some reduction in errors of
wrongful inclusion. Large-scale exclusion of those eligible has been a
feature of most narrowly targeted social protection programmes. For
example, citet:ellis2009social estimated that 83 percent of poor aged
persons were excluded from the Food Subsidy Programme in Mozambique
\index{Mozambique!Food Subsidy Programme} that provides targeted cash
transfers to the old, people with disabilities, and the chronically ill
among the poor. Several studies of targeting in Asia have also
reported large errors of exclusion and leakages (see, for example,
citealp:swaminathan2001errors,swaminathan2000weakening; and
citealp:weiss2005targeting)

#+end_infobox


Evidence from three decades of implementation of targeted anti-poverty
and social protection schemes in the developing countries shows that
the combination of narrow targeting and reduced benefits can render
social protection ineffective in countries where deprivation is
widespread and poverty high. In view of this, a consensus is emerging
that it is best to have broad-based or universal coverage of social
protection that provides rights-based guarantees to a nationally
determined minimum set of goods and services. Endorsing the idea of a
universal social protection floor, the High Level Panel of Eminent
Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda
#+index: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
convened by the United Nations Secretary-General called for "leaving
no-one behind".

\index{social protection!targeting|)}

** Synergies among different types of interventions

When social protection programmes are integrated with rural or
agricultural development policies and nutrition initiatives, the
synergies have strong multiplier effects. Social protection measures
are key to protect the poor from hunger and food insecurity,
especially when decent employment growth has been sluggish. When
integrated with rural and agricultural development policies as well as
special nutrition initiatives, impressive results follow.

\index{social protection!social protection floor} Countries should
implement programmes for a nationally determined basic social
protection floor, and strive to ensure that such programmes cover
everyone and can provide those in need with adequate nutritious
food. Where such programmes have been implemented, even modest public
expenditures have been found to have significant positive impacts on
investment, productivity, and incomes. Integrating social protection
programmes with programmes for agricultural development can maximize
the impact on incomes and productivity, particularly of small-scale
producers. Integration of nutrition programmes with social protection
programmes is crucial for ensuring that special nutritional support
for women, infants, and young children translates into positive
nutritional outcomes.

* Role of Fortification and Supplementation

\chaptermark{Fortification and Supplementation}

Nutrition is complex and multidimensional. While there has not been a
consensus on a broad-based plan to tackle malnutrition across the
world, the problems are better understood now, with options for
addressing malnutrition increasingly well known. The underlying cause
of micronutrient deficiencies is the poor quality of diet, lacking
sufficient nutrient-dense animal-source foods, fruit, and
vegetables. Food-based approaches -- which focus on ensuring that the
diets of people include diverse, nutritionally rich foods -- provide
sustainable long-term solutions for controlling and overcoming
micronutrient deficiencies.

In addition to improving the composition of diets, enhancement of the
nutrient content of staple food through chemical and agronomic
fortification is known to be a cost-effective and complementary means
to deliver specific nutrients such as iron, zinc, and
vitamins. Fortification has been used across many countries through
most of the twentieth century.

More recently, two other approaches have been advocated to tackle
micronutrient deficiencies: genetic biofortification and
supplementation. Genetic biofortification refers to breeding varieties
and hybrids rich in specific nutrients, and introducing these
nutrient-rich foods into people's diets. Supplementation refers to the
direct intake of micronutrients, usually in the form of
tablets/capsules. Of late it has been argued -- most importantly, in
the June 2013 issue of the Maternal and Child Nutrition Series of the
British Medical Association’s influential journal, /The Lancet/ -- that
#+INDEX: Lancet, The@\textsl{Lancet, The}
nutritional supplements provide a rapid and cost-effective means of
dealing with the widespread problem of malnutrition.

What part can fortification -- chemical, agronomic, and genetic --
play in ending malnutrition? Can ending malnutrition be led by
supplementation? This chapter examines the evidence to seek answers to
these questions.

** Chemical fortification of food

\index{fortification|(}

Large-scale fortification has been used since the early twentieth
century to deal with micronutrient deficiencies. Before discussing the
experiences with fortification and their potential, it is important to
distinguish between regulated fortification as part of public
initiatives to deal with specific nutritional deficiencies, and
unregulated commercial uses of fortification, often to claim health
benefits from otherwise not-so-healthy and energy-dense foods. The
discussion here specifically deals with the potential of regulated
fortification in dealing with the problem of micronutrient
deficiencies.

In general, fortification has been effectively deployed in conditions
where
 + a specific micronutrient deficiency is widespread in the
   population;
 + the desired micronutrient requirement is more or less uniform
   across different sections of the population;
 + specific agro-ecological limitations make it difficult to meet
   micronutrient requirements through food systems, at least in the
   short run; and
 + desired micronutrients can be provided along with a widely consumed
   component of the diet without adverse implications of adding the
   micronutrient to the item.

Fortification has often been made mandatory to ensure widespread
adoption of micronutrient-fortified food. In many countries across the
world, governments have made iodization of salt mandatory (see Box
[[box-iodised-salt]]). Similarly, in many countries, vitamin A
fortification of sugar and iron fortification of wheat flour have been
made mandatory.

Fortification is best done through food items regularly consumed by
most of the population. Salt, sugar, cereals, edible oils, and milk
have been commonly used as fortification carriers.  There are several
technical aspects that determine the choice of carrier and the
fortificant used to deal with a particular micronutrient
deficiency. Bio-availability and absorption of a micronutrient depend
on the fortificant and carrier used. For example, absorption of iron
from ferrous sulphate, the most common fortificant used for iron, is
negatively related to the bran content of flour as bran inhibits the
absorption of iron. In the case of iodine, iodine is lost to the
atmosphere in the event of exposure to moisture, heat, and
sunlight. Potassium iodate is known to be a more stable fortificant
than potassium iodide and sodium iodide. The stability of iodized salt
can also be improved by the use of stabilizers and good packaging
parencite:kelly1953,diosady1998stability,biberanak2002. Some
fortificants affect the physical properties of food, like taste and
colour, and thus may not be readily accepted by target populations. In
the 1970s, \index{Guatemala} Guatemala introduced sugar fortified with
NaFeEDTA. However, NaFeEDTA changed the colour of foods and beverages
to which the fortified sugar was added, resulting in its poor
acceptability. The introduction of colour-neutral iron fortificants in
Brazil, on the other hand, has been much more successful
parencite:Pineda1998,beinner2003. There are also significant
differences in the costs of different fortificants
parencite:allen2006guidelines.

Fortification has been most successful in addressing iodine and
vitamin A deficiencies. Iron, folate, and zinc fortifications have
also been widely used; although the success of such programmes has
been mixed.

A review of the literature on fortification programmes across the
world suggests that fortification is most successful where the cost of
fortification is a relatively small share of the total cost of the
product. citet:dartonhill1999 point out that the fortification of
wheat flour in Latin America added less than 0.5 percent to the retail
price of flour. The high costs of fortification make it commercially
less attractive as fortified foods cannot be priced much higher than
unfortified products parencite:hertrampf2002,bressani,dartonhill1999.

Fortification has been most successful where the food item being
fortified is produced on a large scale by a few private or public
producers parencite:bressani. In countries where local small-scale
grain milling is common, fortification is more difficult to implement
and regulate. Implementation of vitamin A fortification of sugar in
many \index{Latin America and the Caribbean} Latin American countries
and salt iodization in many countries across the world has been
feasible because sugar and salt are mainly manufactured in the
organized sector. On the other hand, the impact of iron and folate
fortification of flour on the prevalence of iron-deficiency anaemia
has been mixed. In most Latin American countries, wheat milling is
highly centralized, large scale, and in the organized sector. Most of
these countries have made wheat fortification mandatory. This has been
implemented relatively effectively because of the organized nature of
wheat milling parencite:bressani,dartonhill1999. On the other hand,
iron fortification of maize flour has been limited, not only for
technical reasons, but also because the milling of maize, in
particular wet milling, is much more decentralized and small-scale
than wheat milling. Traditionally, maize is used in Latin America
after \index{Latin America and the Caribbean} nixtamalization, which
involves boiling and soaking maize with lime before grinding it wet
into a dough. The process has been industrialized to a significant
degree through introduction of nixtamalized corn flour as a substitute
for wet-ground corn (maize) dough. This has opened the possibilities
of iron fortification of maize flour in Latin America
parencite:bressani1997.

#+attr_latex: :options [Eradicating Iodine Deficiency through Mandatory Iodine Fortification of Salt]
#+begin_infobox

Iodine deficiency causes diseases like goitre and nodular
hyperthyroidism, and results in reduced productivity. It leads to
cognitive impairment among children. Iodine-deficient pregnant women
face a higher risk of abortion, a higher probability of having babies
with low birth weight and a higher probability of infant mortality
parencite:speeckaert2011value. In 1990, the World Health Assembly
accepted the elimination of iodine deficiency as a public health goal
for all countries.

Various supplementation and fortification methods have been
implemented across the world to deal with iodine deficiency.  In 1994,
a UNICEF--WHO \index{UNICEF} \index{World Health Organization (WHO)} Joint
Committee endorsed iodized salt as a safe and effective strategy for
ensuring sufficient intake of iodine by all persons.

The process of iodization is simple and cost-effective, and does not
alter the taste, odour, and colour of salt. Given that salt is
universally consumed, it is considered an excellent vehicle for
iodine.

Health policies mandating iodization of salt have seen remarkable
progress in improving iodine status and reducing the prevalence of
goitre and cretinism in countries with severe iodine deficiencies. In
#+index: South Africa!iodine deficiency
South Africa, iodization of salt has resulted in the near-eradication
of iodine deficiency in schoolchildren after one year of
implementation parencite:jooste2000short. The long-term supply of
iodized salt in regions of Pakistan
#+index: Pakistan!iodine deficiency
where goitre is endemic resulted in significant decreases in its
prevalence. The proportion of severely iodine deficient households was
reduced to a marginal level with constant monitoring and adjustment in
iodine supplementation levels parencite:ali1992impact. Essentially,
periodic monitoring of iodine status in women and children is
imperative to ensure the efficacy of iodine fortification. The Swiss
population witnessed dramatic reduction in the prevalence of goitre
with the consumption of iodized salt
parencite:allen2006guidelines. Regular monitoring helped the
government in Switzerland to achieve sufficient iodine nutrition in
#+index: Switzerland!iodine deficiency
women and children by changing the concentration of iodine in salt in
response to the changing dietary habits of the population
parencite:zimmermann2005increasing.

As iron deficiency reduces the efficacy of iodine fortification
parencite:allen2006guidelines, some countries have used double
fortification of salt with iodine and iron. A review of evidence
suggests that while double fortification improves the absorption of
iodine, it diminishes the stability of iodine in salt, and the iron
intake through salt only partially covers iron requirements
parencite:boxter2015.

There are three main concerns with the use of iodized salt as the main
means for dealing with iodine deficiency. First, iodine has limited
stability and tends to dissipate over time because of exposure to
moisture, light, and heat. Good packaging and storage, which improve
stability considerably, remain a problem in developing countries and
at the household level.

Secondly, strong evidence links high salt intake to hypertension and
other cardiovascular problems parencite:world2012guideline. A WHO--FAO
Joint Expert Consultation recommended that salt intake be reduced to 5
grams per day per person parencite:whotrs916. Unless the concentration
of iodine in salt is adequately increased, reduced salt intake would
reduce intake of iodine. A decline in iodine intake and reappearance
of iodine deficiency have already been noticed in some developed
countries on account of inadequate intake of iodine
parencite:renner2010. However, increasing the concentration of iodine
reduces its stability, making it difficult to use salt as the main
vehicle for the delivery of iodine. Further research is required to
develop technology to increase the concentration of iodine in salt
without adversely affecting iodine stability and other properties, and
to find other suitable carriers for iodine.

Finally, salt fortification becomes difficult to implement and monitor
where salt production is decentralized. This is important, for
example, in coastal areas, where sea salt is locally
produced. citet:rasheed2001 have shown that only 2 percent of
households consumed iodized salt in the coastal regions of
Bangladesh. The easy availability of untreated salt at lower cost and
lack of awareness of the health effects of iodized salt are the main
factors that limit the use of iodized salt in the coastal areas of
Bangladesh.

#+NAME: iodised-salt
#+caption: Proportion of households consuming adequately iodized salt, by country, 2000--13
#+attr_latex: :environment figure :width \textwidth :placement [H]
#+RESULTS: iodised-salt-in
[[file:iodised.png]]

In all, it is estimated that about 75 percent of households worldwide
use adequately iodized salt. Among the regions, East Asia and the
Pacific has the highest proportion -- 87 percent -- of households
consuming adequately iodized salt, close to the global target of 90
percent salt iodization. In all, 69 countries reached the target of 90
percent coverage of salt iodization by 2011
(citealp:unicefnutrition2013 and Figure [[iodised-salt]]). While
commendable, it is critical to maintain the momentum to ensure iodized
salt for the remaining population of the world. Universal use of
adequately iodized salt requires research coordination for technical
improvements, introduction of mandatory provisions, expanding
awareness-raising, as well as careful regulation and monitoring at the
national level to overcome administrative, social, medical, and other
barriers to eradicating iodine deficiency.
#+end_infobox

\index{salt iodization|)}

On the other hand, in many Asian and African countries with large
rural populations, a substantial part of the food consumed by
households is home-produced, and grain milling is decentralized and on
a small scale. These make implementation and regulation of
fortification more difficult, and its reach across the target
population more limited.  Although there have been some experiments in
distributing pre-mixed nutrients for home fortification, in most of
these countries, fortified flour constitutes a relatively small share
of total consumption.

Although the fortification of salt and sugar has been relatively
successful in many countries, an important concern is that the
promotion of fortified salt and sugar could work against attempts to
reduce salt and sugar intake by the population. It is, therefore,
recommended that promotion of \index{salt iodization} iodized salt and
programmes for reducing salt intake should closely collaborate to
ensure that promotion of the use of iodized salt does not result in
public promotion of salt intake parencite:saltfortification. Some
writings on iron fortification have advocated the use of soft drinks
as a vehicle for iron fortification to deal with iron-deficiency
anaemia among children and women
parencite:Layrisse01011976,wojcicki2010. Such arguments ignore the
serious dietary imbalances and public health problems caused by
increasing the intake of sugar-dense beverages. Promoting sugar-dense
beverages as a vehicle for dealing with iron-deficiency anaemia
carries a serious risk of inducing excess sugar consumption.

Fortification is a cost-effective method of enriching diets to deal
with specific deficiencies. Fortification may be particularly useful
in the short run for populations that buy centrally processed
foods. There are, however, limitations of fortification in reaching
rural consumers for whom much of the basic diet is produced at
home. When micronutrient requirements vary across the population (say,
between men, women, and children), fortification can only be used to
meet the minimal requirement, and may have to be combined with
additional interventions for groups that need additional intake of
micronutrients.

\index{fortification|)}
** Agronomic biofortification

\index{biofortification!agronomic|(}

Another approach to augment the nutrient content of food is through
fortification at the stage of crop production itself. This can be done
either through application of nutrients along with fertilizers or
irrigation water, or by developing crop varieties and hybrids that are
rich in a particular nutrient.

Deficiencies of micronutrients, for example, zinc and iodine, can be
traced in many countries to the depletion of these nutrients in the
soil. Fortification through soil enrichment is known to be an
effective way of dealing with zinc, iodine, and selenium deficiencies
parencite:cakmak2008enrichment,cakmak2009enrichment,Rengel199927,alloway2009soil.

In the Central Anatolia region of Turkey, fertilizers enriched with
zinc were used for cultivation of zinc-absorbent wheat varieties
parencite:Cakmak1999175. It has been argued that zinc enrichment of
#+index: Turkey!zinc deficiency
fertilizers can go a long way in dealing with zinc deficiencies in
India, where about half the soils are deficient in zinc
parencite:cakmak2009enrichment. Hence, the Government of India has
introduced additional subsidies to fertilizer manufacturers for zinc
#+index: India!zinc fertilisers, use of
fortification of fertilizers, and to farmers for using zinc
fertilizers parencite:das2013importance.

In China, potassium iodate was added to canal irrigation water to
enrich the soils with iodine parencite:caoiodine1994. The empirical
#+index: China!iodine deficiency
evidence showed that the iodination of canal water significantly
reduced iodine deficiency among pregnant women, which in turn resulted
in a significant drop in infant and neonatal mortality
parencite:delong2007.

Since the mid-1980s, sodium selenate has been used to enrich
#+index: Finland!selenium intake
fertilizers in Finland. This is known to have helped improve selenium
intake in Finland parencite:aro1995effects,Varo01081988.

Fortification through soil enrichment is particularly useful where the
consumption of staple grains for a large proportion of households is
based on home production. In such cases, the fortification of flour at
the stage of milling may not be effective. Agronomic fortification is
effective and can be introduced relatively quickly without major new
investments in research and extension.

\index{biofortification!agronomic|)}

** Genetic biofortification

\index{biofortification!genetic|(}

More recently, genetic biofortification, which involves enhancing the
nutrition content of crops through breeding, has been promoted as a
new approach to fortification, and is increasingly seen as an
alternative, effective means of delivering specific micronutrients
along with food. A lot of work has been done on biofortification by
HarvestPlus, a CGIAR (Consultative Group for International
Agricultural Research) programme.[fn:14]

\index{Golden Rice|(}

Golden Rice, a variety of rice enriched with vitamin A, is the most
well-known case of a biofortified crop. Proponents of Golden Rice
argue that it has the potential to be a complementary source of
vitamin A, and could be a cost-effective means of reducing vitamin A
deficiency parencite:Dawe2002541,Stein2008144. On the other hand,
critics have argued that the levels of \beta-Carotene in Golden Rice
are too low and do not make sufficient contribution to vitamin A
requirements parencite:grusak2005. There are also economic issues
involved in the adoption of Golden Rice. Its cost-effectiveness
depends on its widespread adoption across Asia. But a single seed
strain is not going to be suitable for the diverse agro-ecological
conditions in which rice is produced across Asia.

Golden Rice has met with great resistance from research and civil
society groups opposed to genetically modified seeds. Very few Asian
countries have legal frameworks in place for testing and introduction
of transgenic food crops. This has resulted in long delays in the
widespread adoption of Golden Rice even to deal with vitamin A
deficiencies.

While Golden Rice \index{Golden Rice|)} has faced obstacles due to
being a genetically modified crop, several other biofortified crops
have been developed through conventional open pollination and other
plant-breeding methods. Some of these have already been released for
production while many others are at different stages of
development. Rich in \beta-Carotene, the Orange Sweet Potato has been
successfully introduced in Mozambique and Uganda \index{Uganda} to
deal with vitamin A deficiencies. Biofortified Orange Sweet Potato
accounts for about 56 percent of the area cultivated with
\index{Mozambique} sweet potato in Mozambique, and about 44 percent of
the area cultivated with sweet potato in Uganda. \index{HarvestPlus}
HarvestPlus, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid
Tropics, various agricultural universities in India, and seed
companies are partnering to produce crossbreeds of high-yielding
#+index: International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT)
pearlt millet that are rich in iron and zinc. A variety rich in iron, ICTP
8203-Fe, was released in India in 2013, and is being tested in
Niger. In Bangladesh, sweet potato, tomato, pumpkin, mango, and guava
enriched with vitamin A have been developed. The Bangladesh Rice
Research Institute has developed rice varieties
\index{Bangladesh!Bangladesh Rice Research Institute} biofortified
with zinc, which have already been released for production by
farmers.[fn:15] In March 2015, the Pakistan Agriculture Research
Council released zinc-fortified varieties of wheat developed in
collaboration with HarvestPlus.[fn:16]
#+index: Pakistan!Pakistan Agriculture Research Council

There is no independent research yet on the impact of the adoption of
biofortified crops on nutritional outcomes of the population at
large. A few studies, all done with the support of agencies involved
in the development of biofortified crops, have shown that introduction
of \beta-Carotene-rich Orange Sweet Potato in Mozambique and Uganda
has lowered the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency among children and
women who consumed the biofortified produce
parencite:hotz2012,hotz2012large. More research and evidence are
needed to assess the cost-effectiveness, acceptability, and impact of
biofortified crops on the overall nutrition of populations. The
incorporation of biofortified crops in the agricultural and nutrition
strategies of countries will require addressing several policy issues
relating to the ownership and control of the technology, the cost of
seeds to farmers, cost at which other complementary inputs (like
fertilizers, pesticides, and water) needed for crop production are
made available to farmers, their suitability to the agro-ecological
context, and the nutritional outcomes of their adoption.

\index{biofortification!genetic|)}

** Supplementation

\index{supplementation|(}

The June 2013 issue of /The Lancet/, as part of its Maternal and Child
#+INDEX: Lancet, The@\textsl{Lancet, The}
Nutrition Series, argued that nutritional supplements provide a rapid
and cost-effective means of dealing with micronutrient
deficiencies.[fn:17] In the issue, citet:bhuttalancet2013 argued that,
unlike conventional strategies based on breastfeeding and provision of
nutritious foods through lunch or noon-meal schemes and other social
protection programmes targeting pregnant women, lactating women, and
children, considerable evidence based on randomized control trials
show the benefits of supplements in reducing the incidence of
stunting. Their detailed analysis of quantitative evidence on the
effects of supplements on nutritional outcomes suggested that a total
investment of US$ 9.6 billion on ten nutrition-related interventions
in thirty-four focus countries would reduce mortality among children
aged less than 5 years by about 15 percent. This finding was used to
make the argument that a supplementation-based strategy to deal with
maternal and child malnutrition is promisingly cost-effective.

While supplementation-led interventions may be appropriate in some
contexts, especially in the short term, or in the face of emergencies
such as conflicts or natural disasters, exclusive focus on
micronutrient supplementation distracts from addressing the deeper
causes of malnutrition, and undermines the development of sustainable
long-term solutions to micronutrient deficiencies. The case for a
supplement-led strategy for dealing with micronutrient deficiencies is
problematic on various grounds.

As pointed out by citet:pinstrupandersen2013aa in a comment on
Maternal and Child Nutrition series papers in /The Lancet/, the
#+INDEX: Lancet, The@\textsl{Lancet, The}
fixation on randomized control trials as the only legitimate evidence
is misplaced as it is impossible to apply such methods to testing food
systems.

An exclusive focus on micronutrient supplementation without addressing
the fundamental causes of malnutrition, particularly those related to
the food system, can be extremely problematic and render nutrition
policies ineffective. In most cases, micronutrient supplementation
cannot be very effective without adequate food. Providing
micronutrients without adequate food can even have negative effects.

Also, while the beneficial effects of some forms of supplementation --
for example, iron supplementation among pregnant women -- are well
established, the evidence is much less clear in many cases. For
example, the efficacy of maternal and neonatal vitamin A
supplementation has been questioned, and the recent recommendations
for inclusion of early neonatal vitamin A supplementation in nutrition
programmes have been severely criticized.[fn:18]

Additionally, focusing on supplements often favours reliance on and
involvement of the biochemical and pharmaceutical industries, which
would develop a vested interest in discouraging alternative long-term
options for addressing malnutrition on a more affordable and
sustainable basis. If the supplements are produced domestically --
which may be better for the national economy -- time and resources
will be needed to establish local manufacturing systems, distribution
systems, and regulatory structures. However, such efforts to develop
national capacities are likely to be thwarted by international trade,
investment, and intellectual property rights agreements and regulations
driven by powerful corporate lobbies.

In view of these problems, the role of supplements is best limited to
dealing with specific, short-term requirements such as providing iron
and folic acid supplements during the period of pregnancy.

** Ending malnutrition: Diet-based or supplementation-led?

In the recent policy literature on nutrition, a distinction is often
made between nutrition-specific interventions and nutrition-sensitive
interventions. Nutrition-specific interventions are based on different
forms of supplementation. Addressing specific forms of malnutrition is
their primary objective. Nutrition-sensitive interventions, on the
other hand, are multisectoral interventions with varied primary
objectives -- for example, alleviation of poverty, development of
agriculture, improving educational attainments, or improving access to
water, sanitation, and health facilities -- that are designed so as to
result in improved nutrition as a side effect.

\index{UNICEF|(}

citet:unicef1990 developed a conceptual framework on causes of
malnutrition in 1990. The framework identified the basic causes (the
socio-economic and political contexts), underlying causes (food
insecurity, inadequate health care, unhealthy household environment),
and immediate causes (inadequate dietary intake and diseases) of
malnutrition, and was used to develop UNICEF's multisectoral strategy
on malnutrition among women and children. This was one of the first
attempts to conceptualize multisectoral linkages of nutrition, and has
been adapted and widely used to guide the nutrition strategies of many
agencies worldwide (see chapter [[#governancechapter]]).

\index{UNICEF|)}

More recently, the \index{Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN)} Scaling Up
Nutrition (SUN) movement's Framework for Action paper called for
combining the scaling up of nutrition-specific interventions with
broader multisectoral approaches citep:SUNframework. This approach has
been widely accepted by many international agencies as well as
countries. The \index{World Bank} World Bank's paper on multisectoral
approaches towards nutrition builds upon the SUN Framework for Action
to develop guidelines for making the World Bank's interventions in
various sectors nutrition-sensitive
citep:wbmultisectoralnutrition. \index{USAID} USAID's 2014
Multisectoral Nutrition Strategy identifies scaling up "effective,
integrated nutrition-specific and -sensitive interventions, programs,
and systems across humanitarian and development contexts" as its
strategic objective citep:usaidnutrition2014. \index{DFID} DFID's
position paper on undernutrition talks of a two-pronged strategy to
deal with child stunting: first, scaling up nutrition specific
interventions, and second, to use nutrition-sensitive interventions to
deal with residual child stunting that cannot be eradicated merely by
nutrition-specific interventions citep:dfidnutrition2011.

Although recognizing the complementary role of nutrition-sensitive
multisectoral interventions, most of these recent approaches give
primacy to nutrition-specific interventions. Concrete, actionable
strategies with precise estimates of costs are presented for
nutrition-specific interventions. On the other hand,
nutrition-sensitive interventions in other areas, including in food
systems, are presented as complementary strategies, typically without
specific budgetary commitments. This misplaced emphasis on
supplementation needs to be corrected.

It is important that nutrition strategies are based on the centrality
of food systems in providing nutrition. Good nutrition requires, first
and foremost, ensuring availability of and access to more diverse
diets and nutritious foods. In most cases, micronutrients can be
delivered cost-effectively and sustainably through diverse and
adequately nutritious diets. This requires that food systems are
developed to make available a diverse variety of foods; that social
protection systems are put in place to ensure everyone has access to
adequate and nutritious foods; that access to safe water, and improved
sanitation and basic health care, are available for all.

\index{fortification|(} Where necessary, and where cost-effective
technologies are easily available, the nutrient content of food may be
enhanced through fortification. Certain types of regulated
fortification -- salt iodization, for example -- are an essential
component of the strategy to make food systems
nutrition-sensitive. Regulated fortification can be used for specific
problems such as iodine deficiency, for which solutions are easily
available and impacts well established. Greater evidence is needed to
assess the cost implications, efficacy and impact of
\index{biofortification!genetic} new approaches like genetic
biofortification.  \index{fortification|)}

Supplementation may also be necessary at times as an urgent short-term
solution when specific categories of people (for example, pregnant
women and infants) are severely nutrient-deficient and immediate
interventions are needed. Some micronutrients, such as iron and folic
acid, are commonly delivered to pregnant women through supplements in
both rich and poor countries. Supplementation can be used selectively
in such contexts, though these have to be accompanied with
simultaneous interventions to ensure adequate food intake.

The ICN2 Framework for Action provides a useful guide in this

:END:

\chaptermark{Access to Safe Water and Sanitation}

Improving access to safe water, sanitation, and basic health services
is crucial for the absorption of nutrients that are consumed. Thus it
is crucial that efforts to improve diets are combined with
improvements in access to safe water, sanitation, and health
care. Since issues of access to health care are complex and need to be
treated separately, we focus here on outlining the nature of the gaps
in access to safe water and sanitation, and the policy priorities for
closing these gaps.

** Impact of access to safe water and sanitation on malnutrition

Unsafe water and unhygienic sanitation practices result in several
infectious diseases, most notably diarrhoea and soil-transmitted
helminths (STH, worms). Compounded by the lack of access to basic
health services, diarrhoea and STH severely reduce the absorption of
nutrients that are consumed. Unsafe water and poor sanitation cause a
number of other infectious diseases which increase the need for
nutrients and diminish appetites. In the worst situations,
malnutrition and diarrhoea can form a vicious cycle as a malnourished
person becomes more susceptible to infections and the diseases become
more persistent.

There is strong empirical evidence of the adverse impacts of lack of
access to safe water and sanitation on health and malnutrition.
citet:annette2004 estimated that, in 2000, unsafe water, sanitation,
and hygiene accounted for 1.73 million deaths and 88 percent of the
total burden of infectious diarrhoea. In a systematic review of
studies of the impact of improvement in access to safe water and
sanitation on the morbidity of different diseases,
citet:esrey1991effects found that improvement in access to water and
sanitation accounted for a median of 26 percent reduction in the
incidence of diarrhoea.  In a detailed study of eight Sub-Saharan
countries, citet:Esrey1996 found that improvements in access to safe
sanitation resulted in \index{stunting} taller and heavier children.
Interestingly, citet:Esrey1996 found that improvements in water supply
influenced the incidence of diarrhoea and nutritional outcomes only
when accompanied by improvements in sanitation and when safe water was
available from a source on the household
premises. citet:smithhaddad2015, in a detailed econometric assessment
of the determinants of decline in \index{stunting} child stunting
using data for 116 developing countries for a forty-two-year period
between 1970 and 2012, found that improvements in access to safe water
and sanitation accounted for about 38 percent of the decline in
prevalence of child stunting during that period.

** Gaps in access to safe water and sanitation

Gaps in safe water supply to household premises and access to improved
sanitation are large. Globally, expansion of access to improved
sanitation -- which often goes hand in hand with expansion of the
availability of water on household premises -- remains the more
widespread problem of the two.

According to the latest statistics available from the WHO--UNICEF
Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, for 2012,
about 2.5 billion people all over the world did not have access to
improved sanitation practices (Table [[sanitation-table]]), while 750
million persons did not have piped water on the premises of their
homes (Table [[water-table]]). Expanding access to safe drinking water and
improved sanitation has been much more difficult for rural
populations. In 2012, over 80 percent of the people who did not have
access to safe water supply in their household premises, and over 70
percent of those who did not have access to improved sanitation lived
in rural areas.

A total of 325 million persons or over 40 percent of the population of
Sub-Saharan Africa did not have access to piped water on their
premises. \index{Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)} The region is
expected to miss the MDG target of halving the proportion of people
without access to safe drinking water. About 150 million people in
South Asia, 114 million in East Asia, and 67 million in Southeast Asia
lacked piped water supply to home premises (Figure [[water-region]]). Of
the global population who did not have access to improved sanitation,
about 67 percent lived in Asia and about 26 percent in Sub-Saharan
Africa (Table [[sanitation-table]] and Figure [[sanitation-region]]). South
Asia, and in particular India, has made very slow progress in
expanding sanitation (Box [[box-sanitation-india]]).

Lack of safe sanitation is a problem of enormous proportions in
India. According to the latest statistics from the WHO--UNICEF Joint
Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, India alone
accounted for 31 percent of the world's population without access to
improved sanitation.

According to the 2011 Census of India, only 44 percent of Indian
households had improved sanitation facilities. Among rural households,
this proportion was a dismal 28 percent. With lack of toilets and
water on household premises, open defecation is widely prevalent in
India (Table \ref{sanitation-india}). The availability of sanitation
facilities in public spaces is also very poor. In 2013--14, about 13
percent of India's schools had no toilets parencite:dise2013.

Lack of sanitation has important gender and social dimensions. Lack of
sanitation facilities at home specifically inconveniences women,
exposes them to the worst forms of sexual violence, and harms their
health even more than for men
parencite:sharmaasmita2015,kulkarnisanitation. National statistics
also show continued disparities in access to sanitation across caste
and social groups
parencite:thorat2009,shamsher2014,chawla2014,msss2014. In a detailed
sociological study of determinants of access to basic amenities in
rural India, citet:shamsher2014 shows that social exclusion in rural
India, particularly as seen in the segregation of residential areas
among different social groups, and continued economic differences
contribute to continued social and caste disparities in access to
sanitation, safe drinking water, and other basic amenities.

Statistical evidence shows that poor access to safe water, sanitation,
and hygiene are major determinants of nutritional outcomes in
India. Detailed statistical analysis by citet:spearsheight2013 showed
that "open defecation can account for much or all of excess stunting"
among children in India.

There is also a huge gap in the access to safe drinking
water. According to data from the 2011 Census of India, only 32
percent of Indian households had access to tap water from a treated
source. Lack of a safe water source on household premises is a major
factor behind the large proportion of Indian households not being able
to use safe sanitation facilities. As shown in Figure
[[india-sanitation]], there is a large overlap in regions that have
performed poorly in terms of access to sanitation and water.

The national government in India has introduced specific programmes to
tackle the problem of sanitation since the mid-1980s. These programmes
have mainly focused on providing financial support for the
construction of toilets and activities to raise public
awareness. Despite a significant increase in public expenditure
(Figure [[india-sanitation-exp]]), these programmes have only had limited
success in expanding access to safe sanitation. A recent study shows
that a significant proportion of toilets constructed under the Total
Sanitation Programme, \index{India!Total Sanitation Programme} a
flagship programme of the national government in the area of
sanitation, have ceased to exist and are not in use
parencite:arjun_sanitation_2014. In a review of the Total Sanitation
Programme, citet:hueso2013untold found that "only one in five latrines
reportedly constructed since 2001 were in place in 2011. The rest
either had become unusable due to bad construction quality and lack of
maintenance, or were not fully built in the first place." Lack of
synergy between rural water supply programmes and rural sanitation
programmes, inadequate emphasis on awareness-building and hygiene
education, and lack of community participation have been identified as
the main reasons for the lack of success of public sanitation
programmes in India.

** Policy lessons from past experiences

Access to improved sanitation is closely related to the development of
public infrastructure for drainage, waste treatment, and waste
disposal. In most developing countries, rural sanitation programmes
have focused on promoting solutions based on safe on-site sewage
disposal because of the impracticality of centralized effluent sewage
disposal. Further, the need to keep costs low has meant the use of
low-cost materials that typically are difficult to maintain and clean,
thus frustrating the adoption of improved sanitation. Although several
technical solutions have been proposed and attempted, the difficulties
in maintaining and cleaning low-cost toilets remain an important
barrier to widespread adoption of improved sanitation.

In addition, as shown in Figure [[water-sanitation]], access to improved
sanitation is also closely related to supply of piped water to
household premises. In general, the existence of piped water supply is
a prerequisite for improved household sanitation. Some countries,
however, have managed to break this barrier. As shown in Figure
[[water-sanitation]], \index{Sri Lanka} Sri Lanka, \index{Vietnam}
Vietnam, \index{Myanmar} Myanmar, \index{Marshall Islands} Marshall
Islands, \index{Rwanda} Rwanda, and \index{Bangladesh} Bangladesh are
particularly noteworthy for having achieved significantly
above-average levels of access to improved sanitation despite
relatively limited access to piped water supply. The figure also shows
that, while most high-income countries have good access to piped water

made significant progress in providing access to piped water and
improved sanitation despite low per capita income levels.

A large body of empirical literature from across the world has found a
significant positive impact of education, in particular women's, on
the adoption of improved sanitation. Policymakers, civil society
activists and researchers have all highlighted the importance of
building awareness for improving sanitation.

\index{World Bank!Water and Sanitation Programme|(}

In recent years, an alternative approach called Community-led Total
Sanitation (CLTS) has been implemented in many countries.  Having its
origin in a micro-level programme in Bangladesh, CLTS was mainstreamed
by the Water and Sanitation Programme (WSP) led by the World Bank, and
implemented in twenty-five countries across Asia and Africa. Since the
early 1990s, the WSP started to move away from supporting public
programmes that provided subsidized toilets to households without
toilets. It started supporting CLTS programmes since the early 2000s,
and adopted CLTS as the main approach for sanitation programmes by the
end of the decade.

\index{World Bank!Water and Sanitation Programme|)}

\index{Community-led Total Sanitation (CLTS)|(}

\index{Bangladesh!sanitation|(}

CLTS is based on the idea that lack of adoption of improved sanitation
in a community is not due to economic deprivation or exclusion from
public services, but because of the unwillingness of people to stop
defecating in the open. Proponents of CLTS have argued that public
support for providing toilets is ineffective and should be
/substituted/ by community-level interventions to bring about
behavioural change, while putting the onus of mobilizing resources for
constructing sanitation facilities on the households themselves
parencite:kar2005subsidy,kar2008handbook,sanan2007community,robinson2005scaling.
In a major study on why progress in adoption of improved sanitation in
India has been slow, citet:coffey2014revealed claimed that people
prefer open defecation because they find it "pleasurable".

There are two aspects of the strategy adopted by the CLTS programmes
implemented in various countries. First, under these programmes,
behavioural change is brought about by exposing persons practising
open defecation to shame, public humiliation, and various kinds of
punishment. Monetary fines and humiliating punishments like forcing
the offenders to clean public places are imposed on those who engage
in open defecation. These are expected to humiliate and coerce people
to build toilet facilities, and to stop defecating in the
open. Secondly, it is argued that people value and use toilets only if
they pay for building them. Toilets built with public subsidies lie
unused because people do not value them and see no benefit in using
them parencite:sanan2007community. Thus, no public support is provided
for the construction of toilets, existing programmes that provide
financial support are to be discontinued, and households are to
mobilize their own resources for the construction of toilets. In sum,
under CLTS, the focus of intervention is on preventing the practice of
open defecation, so that people are left with no choice but to find
resources to build toilets for themselves.

Evidence suggests that economic progress does not automatically
translate into improved sanitation. Experience from sanitation
programmes across the world shows that mere provision of funds for the
construction of low-cost toilets is not sufficient for the adoption of
improved sanitation. However, the fact remains that the vast majority
of those who lack improved sanitation are poor, have low levels of
educational attainment, and do not have access to public
infrastructure for water and drainage on their household
premises. Hence, their inability to have or to use a toilet has to be
seen as a deprivation and a failure of entitlements rather than as an
exercise of freedom.

Recent studies, including from the \index{World Bank} World Bank,
doubt that behavioural changes alone can bring about the requisite
increase in the use of improved sanitation. The 2015 /World
Development Report/
#+index: World Development Report@\textsl{World Development Report}
argued that "a program to change social norms about sanitation in
these two countries was important but not sufficient to end open
defecation" parencite:wdr2015. It took the position that programmes
aiming for behavioural change "can complement, but perhaps not
substitute for, programmes that provide resources for building
toilets" parencite:wdr2015.

Assessing sanitation programmes in Bangladesh, often cited by
proponents of CLTS, citet:black2008last point out that progress in
Bangladesh is not merely because of CLTS, but has much to do with
sustained political commitment at the highest level, sustained efforts
of the Department of Public Health Engineering and NGOs, and various
specific socio-economic and ecological conditions. A comparative
assessment of sanitation outcomes in CLTS and non-CLTS villages in
Bangladesh by citet:hanchett2011long showed a substantial increase in
the adoption of improved sanitation in all areas, and no significant
difference between CLTS and non-CLTS villages. The study concluded
that "the government’s commitment may have been the cornerstone for
influencing the social norms in favor of improved sanitation behaviors
and facilities, regardless of the specific
approach". citet:black2008last strongly argue against using CLTS as a
magic bullet to deal with the problem of sanitation regardless of
national contexts.

\index{Bangladesh!sanitation|)}

Given that the inability to have or use toilets fundamentally reflects
a failure of entitlements, the ethical underpinnings of using
humiliation, policing, punishments, and coercion rather than focusing
on provision of sanitation facilities along with education, literacy,
and sustained awareness-building are questionable. A detailed study of
CLTS programmes in Indonesia \index{Indonesia!CLTS} found that "it is
primarily the poor who are the ‘targets’ of this intervention and that
they are, in effect, punished for their poverty and local practices"
parencite:dech12075. citet:dech12075 conclude that "CLTS is clearly a
very intrusive process involving facilitators from outside the village
inspecting individual households and shaming predominantly poor
individuals and households for their circumstances and local
practices."

Experiences from countries that have made significant advances in
access to safe water and improved sanitation suggest that political
commitment at the highest level, involvement of all levels of
government, sustained fiscal support for the development of common
infrastructure and household-level facilities, and a major thrust in
awareness-building programmes hold the key to success in the
area. Community participation in raising awareness and building a
social commitment to sanitation has always been crucial. It is
important to design solutions keeping in mind the local context,
including both constraints and resources, rather than imposing
one-size-fits-all technical or economic solutions. Improvement in the
area of sanitation often goes hand in hand with improvement in access
to water on the household premises. This is particularly important for
rural areas, where the gap in access to water supply on household
premises is substantial in many countries. In such countries,
programmes for development of domestic water supply and sanitation in
rural areas should be planned and implemented together.

Much has changed in recent years, bringing nutrition to the forefront
of the global development agenda. In 2008, the worst food-price spike
in a generation compelled political leaders across the globe to
rethink assumptions and received wisdom about the capacity of economic
growth alone to address food access and malnutrition problems. A
series of articles published at the same time in /The Lancet/ provided
#+INDEX: Lancet, The@\textsl{Lancet, The}
new evidence demonstrating the high human and economic costs of
malnutrition, and issued a clarion call for reform of what the authors
of a paper on international action against undernutrition described as
the “fragmented and dysfunctional” “international nutrition system”
parencite:morris2008effective.

\index{Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN)|(}

Soon afterward, in 2010, the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement was
born, a new type of multi-stakeholder and multisectoral partnership
initiative launched under the administrative aegis of the UN
Secretary-General citep:unpress2012, but with a decidedly open and
flexible governance structure that allows it to be called a movement
rather than a UN initiative or programme. In a relatively short period
of time, SUN has also garnered the active involvement of major donors
and more than 100 major organizations organized into four networks:
donors, civil society, the private sector, and UN system agencies,
funds, and programmes. The SUN movement seeks to organize itself
around the priorities of countries that have subscribed as members of
the movement. By June 2015, SUN had attracted 55 countries to its
ranks.[fn:21]

\index{Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN)|)}

Owing in part to the well-organized advocacy of SUN and bolstered by a
second series of /Lancet/ articles published in 2013, a variety of
#+INDEX: Lancet, The@\textsl{Lancet, The}
complementary initiatives have been launched, including the June 2013
Nutrition for Growth Summit, which focused attention on nutrition and
mobilized more than US$4.15 billion in public investment commitments,
along with US$19 billion in nutrition-sensitive investments, between
2013 and 2020;[fn:58] the launch of the Global Panel on Agriculture
and Food Systems for Nutrition at the same time; and the commitment to
#+index: Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition
publish \index{Global Nutrition Report} the /Global Nutrition Report/,
first published in November 2014 and produced under the editorial
aegis of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) with
#+index: International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
contributions from across the global nutrition community.

\index{Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)|(}

In July 2014, the UN General Assembly’s Open Working Group on
Sustainable Development Goals produced a report calling for 17 new
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets. That report has
been subsequently accepted as the basis, with only minor technical
adjustments, for the post-2015 development agenda that will be adopted
by the UN member-states at a special summit in September 2015. The new
SDGs include at least six headline goals and eighteen targets
materially relevant to nutrition, including not only targets that
specifically mention nutrition, but also targets such as poverty
eradication, improved food systems, women’s empowerment, and improved
access to safe water and sanitation -- which, when combined, present a
comprehensive approach not only to enhance efforts on nutrition, but
also to address its underlying causes. While the process may only
endorse one or two indicators of malnutrition, the potential number of
nutrition-related indicators may be much larger.

\index{Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)|)}

\index{Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2)|(}

In light of these developments, the Second International Conference on
Nutrition (ICN2), which took place in Rome in November 2014,
represented a culminating event. Jointly organized by the Food and
Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization,
\index{World Health Organization (WHO)} both United Nations
specialized agencies, ICN2 was an effort to integrate and unify a
broad range of activities within a defined set of intergovernmentally
endorsed political commitments, and to provide a flexible and
comprehensive framework for action. Achieving broad agreement among
the world’s nation-states is always a challenge, and is made even more
challenging when the issues are as complex as they are with
nutrition. Thus, while ICN2’s two outcomes -- the Rome Declaration and
Framework for Action -- did not break new ground in knowledge or
policy, they made a major contribution to nutrition action by forging
a new intergovernmental consensus on the needed scale and scope for
adequate policy action.

The ICN2 has thus given impetus to efforts to reform and adapt
existing institutional arrangements for coordination of collective
action at global, regional, and national levels. It has been a timely
reassertion of the universal relevance of nutrition issues, and has
established an inclusive balance among the broad array of policy and
technical emphases extant in the revival of nutrition activity across
the globe. The ICN2, in short, was a summing up and ratification by
the largest meeting of governments and non-state actors assembled
against malnutrition in history. It marks the climax of the
agenda-setting phase of nutrition activism and heralds the next phase:
a concerted collective action to improve nutrition across the world.

\index{Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2)|)}

** /Déjà vu?/

Does this mean that all the `heavy lifting' has been completed to
build political momentum for a major breakthrough on nutrition? From
past experience the answer is no. This is not the first time that the
world community, armed with new evidence of the developmental
consequences of malnutrition and new policy approaches, has attempted
to put nutrition at the forefront of the global development agenda. A
real breakthrough is possible but, to realize this potential, further
action is necessary to overcome the forces of political inertia that
have doomed past global initiatives on malnutrition.

At least twice before, about two decades apart, the world community
has rallied around a new or renewed vision of the relevance of
nutrition for development. \index{World Bank} In the early 1970s, the
then World Bank President Robert McNamara \index{McNamara, Robert}
called for a reorientation in the Bank's mission, shifting emphasis to
poverty reduction. In his annual address to the Bank's Board of
Governors on 27 September 1971, McNamara \index{McNamara, Robert}
described malnutrition as “a major barrier to human development” and
said to the finance ministers of the world: “the central conclusion I
wish to propose to you is that the international development community
and the individual governments of the countries concerned must face up
to the importance and implications of the nutrition problem” (cited in
citealp:herforth2014, p. 8).  The new emphasis on improved nutrition
as essential for development was supported by the scientific finding
of the previous decade that malnutrition could lead to lifelong
physical and cognitive impairment, and was given additional political
impetus by the world food crisis created by the food price spike of
1972--73.

In the event, however, \index{World Bank} World Bank executives and
development specialists were uneasy about the idea of investing in
nutrition, and embedded the new nutrition emphasis in work on
integrated rural development. The result was a flourishing
programmatic emphasis on multisectoral planning in which nutrition
targets and monitoring were seldom well-defined
(citealp:herforth2014, p. 11). By the end of the 1970s and in the
early 1980s, both integrated rural development and its handmaiden,
multisectoral planning for nutrition, were in crisis for having failed
to produce significant results. Both would soon be abandoned
altogether in the face of the developing country debt and financial
crises that led to the end of nearly all major forms of development
planning and policy interventions; deep cuts in government budgets,
staffs, and services; and a growing belief among donors and governments
that all economic and social problems, including nutrition, would be
solved by market-induced growth.

\index{International Conference on Nutrition (ICN) |(}
By the early 1990s, the high food and commodity prices of the early
1970s were long gone, and an era of abundant, low-cost world food
supply was expected to lead to progressive alleviation of malnutrition
and food insecurity. When this did not happen, efforts were once again
renewed to draw world attention to the key developmental
importance of addressing malnutrition, including both undernutrition
and undernourishment. The 1992 International Conference on Nutrition
(ICN) drew attention to the former, and the \index{World Food Summit}
1996 World Food Summit (WFS) to the latter.

Despite the absence of a trigger event such as the 1972--73, or the
2008, 2010--11, and 2012 food-price spikes, these two global
conferences of the 1990s did contribute to a broader awareness that
the problems of undernutrition and undernourishment could not be
solved by the availability of food alone. Special interventions, it
was recognized, would be needed to address the economic, social, and
environmental causes of malnutrition, and to ensure access to safe
food.[fn:22] The ICN also helped to spur renewed commitment to
nutrition as a key public objective. The 1992 World Declaration on
Nutrition
#+index: World Declaration on Nutrition
included a pledge to “eliminate hunger and reduce all forms of
malnutrition”, and the accompanying Plan of Action for Nutrition
called for a revival or strengthening of planning through a new
generation of National Plans of Action for Nutrition (NPANs). The ICN
delegates committed “to revise or prepare, before the end of 1994, our
national plans of action, including attainable goals and measurable
targets, based on the principles and the relevant strategies in the
Plan of Action” (citealp:nishida2013). Based on analyses of country
situations, the NPANs reintroduced multisectoral thinking, and were to
be developed with broad participation from governments, both national
and local, NGOs, and the private sector.  The initial results were
promising. A 1995 FAO survey found that by 1994, 54 countries had
completed NPANs, and that progress was being made in another 71
countries.[fn:23]

The 1990s' effort took place in an era when planning and state
interventions, more generally, were discouraged. Still, nutrition
experts recognized and continued to emphasize that malnutrition has
many causes, and that addressing it requires concerted actions to
improve systems for production, including processing, of food, health,
sanitation, and water. Figure [[unicefframe]] reproduces an iconic diagram
of the linkages between basic, underlying, and immediate causes of
malnutrition that was first presented in a Policy Review submitted to
the UNICEF Executive Board in March 1990, and that remains, in various
iterations, a touchstone of nutrition policy discussion today.[fn:59]
Here, in the language of the time, the multiple causes of malnutrition
are elegantly mapped with different horizontal layers that begin with
deep, “basic” causes that include economic and social exclusion,
discrimination or vulnerability. These link to unequal control over
resources and result in “underlying” causes -- impacts on households,
and health and sanitation systems -- that in turn contribute to
“immediate” causes of malnutrition in the form of mutually reinforcing
factors of inadequate dietary intake and disease. All these causes
culminate ultimately in malnutrition and premature death.

Yet there were few takers outside of the “nutrition community” for a
comprehensive approach, and the period has become known
retrospectively as the era of “nutrition isolation” -- a time when the
nutrition community found itself forced to go it alone. Nutrition work
became more narrowly focused on addressing micronutrient deficiencies
through nutrition-specific interventions, where, it was believed,
linkages between actions and results could be more effectively
demonstrated. In the end, the second cycle of global nutrition efforts
ended with an echo of the first. Few NPANs were ever implemented,
international coordination became increasingly fractured and
competitive, interventions became more micro- and project-oriented,
and donor support ever harder to find.

Seen in perspective, the current moment appears less unique, less
“unprecedented”, with the risk of failure more real and more
worrisome.  There is, to be sure, much in the present context that can
be used to make a case that this time is different. The strength of
the underlying science and accumulation of country- and
context-specific evidence; the breadth and level of donor support; the
availability of a new set of policy instruments classed as “social
protection” to address some of the basic and underlying causes of
malnutrition; the entry of a host of new social actors in the form of
NGOs, CSOs, well-endowed philanthropies, and new social movements; and
the emergence of new partnership initiatives such as the SUN movement:
\index{Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN)} all herald a potential for
effective action that is arguably far greater than at any time in the
past. But the question is whether these factors alone can overcome the
political impediments and inertia that overwhelmed past efforts to
achieve an accelerated impact to reduce malnutrition. These
impediments and inertia have less to do with the availability of
knowledge and evidence, or benevolent intentions, and much more to do
with nutrition governance -- or, to put it another way, the political
economy of nutrition action.

** Confronting the political economy of nutrition

Today, the main sources of friction and inertia remain the same ones
that have repeatedly undermined nutrition efforts in the
past. Nutrition advocates agree on at least five large and persistent
causes of nutrition failure over the years. First, those who suffer
most from malnutrition, almost by definition, are the marginal and
disadvantaged; in nearly all countries, they are an uninfluential
minority, even where malnutrition is widespread, and where those who
suffer from malnutrition normally lack a voice and the capacity for
effective political action. Thus, national political incentives to
address malnutrition are inherently and persistently weak. In the
battle for high-level policy attention, the forces of political
inertia work constantly to suppress nutrition in “a low-priority
cycle” citep:natalicchio2009carrots.

Secondly, effective solutions require actions by a wide variety of
actors from different ministries, agencies, and organizations,
including private sector entities and other non-state actors, with
different disciplines and different narratives for both causes and
solutions, and with different and often competing institutional
priorities and interests.[fn:24] Bringing and holding “the nutrition
community” together, accordingly, will be no mean feat. Fragmentation
and rivalry are in-built and cannot be wished away. Seasoned hands and
conventional wisdom both caution against policy and programmatic
initiatives that depend on high levels of cross-sectoral coordination
and collaboration: the organizational barriers to such collaboration
are both “durable and strong” and “the risk is too great that such
coordination will not happen”.[fn:25]

\index{private sector engagement|(}

Thirdly, the risks and challenges of engaging the private sector,
especially the large transnational food and drink corporations that
dominate global processed-food production and distribution, present a
special set of major challenges for an inclusive, ‘big tent' approach
to mobilizing nutrition action. The record of hostility to the public
regulation of producers of unhealthy processed food and drinks, and
their ongoing efforts to circumvent established norms and regulations
in both developed and developing countries -- e.g., the International
Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes -- make issues of
conflict of interest a source of deep concern and division.[fn:60]
These concerns are not without warrant. A literature review in /The
Lancet/ found no evidence that self-regulation by industry or
#+INDEX: Lancet, The@\textsl{Lancet, The}
public--private partnerships enhances policy effectiveness or food
quality and safety, but provided significant evidence of the ways that
engagement with the private sector served to distort or undermine
public health policies and programmes parencite:moodie2013profits. The
authors identified several strategies used by large companies to
deflect public attention from the negative health effects of highly
processed foods, and to block or divert efforts at regulation:
distortion and bias of research;[fn:61] cooptation of policymakers and
health professionals; intense lobbying against public regulation
including direct attacks on WHO
#+index: World Health Organization (WHO)}
and other international organizations; and public or social marketing
campaigns designed to shape public opinion, for example, by reframing
public health issues as issues of consumer or personal choice. The
authors of the review concluded that any engagement with the private
sector must include strong firewalls against private sector engagement
in policy and regulatory issues -- a recommendation that has been
fiercely resisted both by industry and by many donor
governments. Advocacy for a broad partnership approach that includes a
strong appeal to private sector inclusion must deal with these
concerns, and demonstrate that any mechanisms established to foster
private sector engagement in nutrition action will be backed by
firewalls and active monitoring to avoid undermining key public policy
objectives.

\index{private sector engagement|)}

Fourthly, despite the critical importance of nutrition for development
and mounting evidence of the high value-for-money of nutrition
investments, nutrition has no natural institutional home and,
therefore, no natural champion. Delivery of nutrition services is
normally the responsibility of agencies or ministries such as
agriculture, health, sanitation, social services, or water, which, in
many cases, do not see nutrition as a primary responsibility or a
primary interest of their constituencies.

The fifth factor is the matter of capacity, not just for the design of
high-quality, potentially high-impact nutrition policy, but especially
for the more challenging and costly implementation and management of
those policies, as well as the patient building of institutions
through which policies are supported. Achieving the required global
expansion of nutrition actions depends on many things going well, and
on many people acquiring the requisite knowledge, skills, and
resources. Building capacity is a slow process that can be accelerated
only with substantial international cooperation. Too often, especially
in countries with a heavy burden of malnutrition, sustained nutrition
action depends on sustained financing, which is only possible through
sustained external support.

All five factors work continuously, like gravity, to weigh down
nutrition action. To overcome them, strong levers are needed that go
beyond focus and commitment. In the remainder of this chapter, we
address three groups of questions concerning the political economy of
nutrition governance, and particularly focus on the role of the
multilateral system as a promoter, sustainer, and enabler of
country-level commitment and action to provide answers to them.

** Key issues in global governance for nutrition

A first set of questions asks: how can the political momentum gained
in recent years be sustained against the persistently powerful
economic, social, and environmental forces that work to disperse and
undo nutrition efforts over time? Achieving nutrition impacts is a
work of years, if not decades, with measures that must be monitored
over half-decades and longer. Policy must be sustained beyond a single
champion in the presidency or a leading ministry, and must survive
regular changes in government. Against the prevailing forces of
entropy, the case for focused, sustained action and investment in
nutrition must be made repeatedly, and government and donor
propensities to change emphases must be resisted or overcome. The need
for complementary action across sectors does not by itself
automatically give rise to coordinated planning; rather it presents a
recurring challenge to governments and their constituencies.

Secondly, if a global strategy and effort are required, how can the
world community best organize to sustain a significant effort over at
least a decade and beyond? In particular, what can and must be done at
the global and regional levels to enable effective action at the
country level? What institutional arrangements and structures are
required to support this activity? And how can these activities and
structures adapt or respond to new information and events?

Thirdly, what are the appropriate roles and expected contributions of
United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, and allied
international organizations, in a world of many more and diverse
development partners whose collective resources dwarf those that can
be mobilized by the UN system alone? Should the UN agencies be counted
as simply one among many partners for countries, or should there be a
differentiation of roles based on the unique responsibilities and
accountability of UN agencies in relation to member-states? One
important potential role of the UN agencies, which follows from their
unique standing in the multilateral system, is to serve as facilitator
and coordinator of international support. But is it realistic for
agencies that also seek donor funds to serve as neutral and trusted
facilitators of actions?  Do the agencies themselves want to play this
role, especially if playing it would restrict their own fund-raising
activities? Since they cannot establish a credible field presence
without strong donor support, it would be self-defeating for UN
entities to focus exclusively on normative and policy guidance, and
eschew any responsibility for delivery or implementation.

** Overcoming inertia: The vital contribution of {{{NEWLINE}}} Sustainable Development Goals
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Overcoming inertia: The vital contribution of Sustainable Development Goals
:END:

In developing answers to these questions, we focus particularly on the
role of global governance -- the multilateral, especially UN-centred,
processes and institutions that help to set norms, standards, and
expectations, provide appropriate (non-prescriptive, norm-based) policy
guidance, enable measurement and monitoring of standardized results,
mobilize resources and facilitate coordinated action by many actors
across sectors and disciplines.

Ultimately, most effective actions to improve nutrition outcomes take
place at the country level rather than at the regional or global
level. But it is a fallacy to assert that global and regional advocacy
and coordination efforts are therefore necessarily redundant,
inefficient or ineffective, and therefore a dispensable means of
sustaining effective country-level action. To overcome the forces of
inertia and fragmentation, it is vital to recognize that important
action needs to be taken at all levels, including the international
and regional levels, to sustain high-level national political
attention to nutrition. Attending only to the national level may
weaken nutrition champions and leave them without important sources of
information, guidance, and moral and financial support when they
confront strong national inertia, political competition and
complexity, and powerful institutional rivalries. The potential for
effective national action, as the experience of the UN Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs)
#+index: Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
shows, can be greatly strengthened and sustained by an international
milieu that provides strong norms; simplified, consistent, flexible,
and adaptable policy guidance; facilities for knowledge and
experience-sharing among political leaders; resources for building
technical and institutional capacity; and comparable data for
measuring and monitoring progress.

\index{Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)|(}

One of the most important vehicles for building a global milieu for
sustained nutrition action, therefore, is the post-2015 development
agenda, at whose core are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
and their 169 Targets. Nutrition looms large in the new framework. As
noted earlier, the SDGs, which will formally be adopted by the UN
member-states in September 2015, contain at least six goals and
eighteen targets that are materially related to nutrition
outcomes. Together, they work at all levels of the political economy
of nutrition outlined in Figure [[unicefframe]], addressing `basic' issues
of social and economic marginalization such as women's empowerment and
access to resources; “underlying” causes, such as weak systems for
food and water access, health, and sanitation; and immediate causes,
such as inadequate uptake and absorption of nutrients, and diseases
that are both the cause and consequence of malnutrition. The question,
of course, is how can action on all these fronts be best organized and
sustained?

For many observers, the sheer number of goals and targets in the new
SDGs has itself become a major cause of bewilderment and criticism. In
a published comment in /The Lancet/, the editor Richard Horton gave
#+INDEX: Lancet, The@\textsl{Lancet, The}
pointed expression to these concerns: “The SDGs are fairy tales”, he
wrote, “dressed in the bureaucratese of intergovernmental narcissism,
adorned with the robes of multilateral paralysis, and poisoned by the
acid of nation-state failure. Yet this is served up as our future''
citep:horton2014offline. Given the stakes, one can easily understand
the frustration, and perhaps even the bitterness, behind such
remarks. But these are fundamentally misplaced, reflecting a deep
misunderstanding of both the logic and intention behind the successor
generation of global development goals.

The new SDGs depart from the previous generation's development agenda
in three essential respects. First, they are the product of an
intergovernmental process based on the multilateral principle; in
other words, they have been written, and owned, by the UN
member-states. Secondly, they are intended to be universally relevant
and are defined to constitute a global social, economic, and
environmental compact that aims to induce ambitious and transformative
action, albeit without being prescriptive. They are a vision that
reflects language agreed on by consensus of 193 nations, with balances
of interests and compromises that reflect contemporary political
reality in all its unavoidable complexity. Thirdly, they deliberately
eschew the specificity that characterized the previous developmental
goals, precisely because it was widely recognized that the segregated,
siloed or vertical approaches of the MDGs missed
#+index: Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
out on key developmental linkages necessary for accelerated impact and
long-term sustainability.

The last point bears particular emphasis. There are no true
stand-alone goals in the new SDGs, despite the habit of many
commentators of describing the headline goals in these terms. On close
inspection, each goal is itself an amalgam of several desiderata. SDG
2, for example, reads: “End hunger, achieve food security and improved
nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.” The targets carry the
same integrative agenda to another level. Target 2.2 of SDG 2 states:
“by 2030 end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving by 2025
the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children
under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent
girls, pregnant and lactating women, and older persons.''  The goals
and targets do in fact set up an extraordinarily ambitious agenda, but
provide only limited substantive guidance on how it is to be
implemented. For that, a supplement is needed -- a trigger to unlock
the potential of the new framework, backed by a system that can
provide the impetus to action, legitimated norms, time-bound
frameworks, appropriate technical and policy guidance, robust
monitoring, and mechanisms for systemic learning and adaptation.

** Needed: A trigger for unified global support

The key to overcome political fragmentation and inertia, and to
sustain action at the national level, paradoxically, lies at the
global level. The new SDGs, properly understood, provide a
comprehensive and potentially powerful global set of
intergovernmentally agreed goals and targets for sustained action over
a period of fifteen years -- an agenda that comprehensively addresses
all the causes of malnutrition. If we look beyond the segregated silos
that defined the MDGs, understand that the SDGs are designed to enable
the development of broad laterally integrative strategies, and accept
that there are therefore no true “stand-alone” goals in the new
framework for any sector or “vertical”, we could begin to recognize
their true value in creating the possibility for sustained action on
nutrition.

\index{Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2)|(}

But to make all these elements cohere, it is essential to consolidate
the broad array of political commitments that have been made into a
unified framework for action and then back it with an effective set of
mechanisms for animating the global commitment to nutrition in all its
dimensions. The first task was accomplished with the twin outcomes of
ICN2: the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for
Action. What remains is to provide the trigger, adjust the
international architecture for nutrition and energize it.

The natural trigger for following up ICN2 would be the one recommended
to the United Nations General Assembly in the Rome Declaration: a
ten-year programme of action, which could be branded as a
comprehensive UN Decade of Action on Nutrition, supported by all UN
institutions, member-states, and allied organizations. A more modest
alternative would be to fashion a schedule of UN system reporting
under the standard rubric of “follow-up to a major UN conference”,
that could be designed to tie together the disparate indicators and
monitoring of actions and institutional developments for nutrition in
the SDGs. The costs of both options would be modest, with most
expenses being borne by the respective UN entities out of their own
resources in fulfilment of their mandates. The chief difference is at
the level of UN system coordination, which depends principally on
agencies, funds, and programmes' willingness to work together in
support of a global agenda, and also at the level of publicity that
can be generated by the UN's Department of Public Information, which
has the capacity to significantly increase the visibility of UN
messages at the global scale.

The proposed UN decade met with resistance from countries concerned
about making action-commitments on specific topics while the new SDGs
were still being negotiated. The second idea would be a fall-back and
would likely not receive the high-level publicity that a UN decade
typically generates, but could still provide powerful incentives to
coordinated action in a UN system called upon to demonstrate that it
is “fit for purpose” in supporting the new SDGs. The UN General
Assembly
#+index: UN General Assembly
adopted a resolution welcoming the ICN2 outcomes on 6 July 2015, but
decided at the same time to postpone consideration of follow-up
actions, including the question of the decade, until after the
conclusion of the SDG Summit in September 2015. By then, it should be
clear that supporting the SDGs necessarily implies supporting a broad
and ambitious global agenda on all forms of malnutrition --
undernourishment, undernutrition, especially micronutrient
deficiencies and overweight/obesity.

\index{Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2)|)}

Whichever course is chosen, the key question will remain: is the UN
system[fn:65] really capable of delivering on the promise of the SDGs?
Certainly the UN agencies, funds, and programmes cannot undertake to
provide all the services needed.  Then what is to be their role in
enabling and facilitating action by the various other actors
comprising “the international nutrition system” today? Why would
others accept that role? And how will the UN system organize itself to
play this role?  There are serious doubts about the UN’s approach, as
we have noted, and a history of inter-agency rivalry and competition
that is still to be overcome.  How, then, will the rules of the game
be defined and adjusted?  How will all nutrition action be monitored
so that progress is measured, lessons learned, and success emulated?
And how will all parties -- including UN system agencies -- be
recognized for their contributions or their failures?

\index{Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)|)}

** What is to be done? By whom? And how?

The key requirements for effective action on nutrition are widely
recognized. They include sustained political commitment and
mobilization of effective nutrition action across sectors; provision
of authoritative, evidence-based norms and standards; clear, simple
guidance on policy and regulation; selection and monitoring of
appropriate indicators of progress toward desired nutrition outcomes;
progressive development of institutional as well as individual
capacities, including for strategic leadership and innovation; and, of
course, sustained mobilization of resources to support large-scale
change.

Of these, there are a number of tasks that can be performed most
efficiently or most effectively at the global or supra-national
levels: agreement on appropriate shared norms, goals, and targets;
formulating clear, implementable policy and guidance; setting
nutrition, food, and safety standards; systematic learning from
diverse experiences; selection of indicators and design of instruments
for tracking progress against key targets; and monitoring and
reporting on national, regional, and global performance. This is the
stuff of global governance. Each of these services has a public goods
aspect in that it is unlikely to be supplied privately, and needs an
internationally legitimated process or institution to support it. But
this is not the same as providing all these goods by public
institutions alone.

A vital development in contemporary international governance has been
the increasingly widespread practice of linking intergovernmental
institutions and processes to multistakeholder platforms that make the
process of developing and providing these services more open and
inclusive, a shared responsibility of diverse social actors. The same
development also makes international rule-making more complex and
demanding. And all this in an era when funding for such public
purposes has long been scarce. Thus, the question of what needs to be
done quickly gives way to the questions, who is going to do all this
and how? Specifically, which international institutions are going to
be responsible for which activities? Which are shared responsibilities
and which not? How are such activities to be coordinated and by whom?
Who is to be held accountable and by whom?

** Towards a new international architecture for nutrition

To establish a viable framework for the kind of broad and ambitious
global agenda on nutrition suggested by ICN2 outcomes, it is useful,
first, to think in terms of key functions, and then ask how existing
institutions already fulfil, or can be adapted, streamlined or
strengthened to perform these functions in the most efficient manner
possible. Box [[nutrition-architecture-box]] summarizes the main functions
to be performed in a working global institutional framework that is
adequate to the range of tasks to be performed. It then identifies
existing institutions that can support these functions, the main
responsibilities that each institution currently has or could take on,
and also the mechanisms that exist for making each of these
institutions accountable to the member-states. Nearly all of these
accountability mechanisms are intergovernmental in nature, and most
embody the UN's multilateral principle of sovereign equality, meaning
that the rules are made and oversight conducted in a system in which
all states have an equal voice and vote. A key aspect of the proposed
architecture, in other words, is that nearly all of its elements are
linked to a multilateral intergovernmental process that governs its
design and operations, and assesses its impact.

\index{UN General Assembly|(}

This institutional architecture, for the most part, already exists. At
the apex of the system stands the UN General Assembly (UNGA), the
world's most inclusive and authoritative intergovernmental
deliberative forum. UNGA decisions, carried by consensus, reflect the
general will of the global community and therefore considerable
political legitimacy, even if, like in all legislative bodies, they
bear the imprint of conflict and compromise. The UNGA, directly or
through delegated authorities, sets the global development agenda on
terms mutually agreed by developed and developing countries, and
thereby determines the priorities of UN agencies, funds, and
programmes. The prolonged process to define a new post-2015
development agenda, with \index{Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)}
SDGs at the core, is fundamental for global governance, embracing not
only prioritized goals and targets, but also institutional frameworks
for implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Major
intergovernmental conferences, such as the 2012 Conference on
Sustainable Development, are often mandated by the UNGA, and the
outcomes of such conferences are not considered fully endorsed by the
UN member-states unless they are explicitly confirmed by a subsequent
UNGA resolution. The ICN2 outcomes were formally welcomed by the UNGA
on 6 July 2015.[fn:62]

\index{UN General Assembly|)}

While deliberating on the new development agenda, UN member-states
devoted considerable attention to implementation issues, and
recognized the need for a robust system for monitoring, reporting, and
evaluating progress. A major institutional innovation for monitoring
SDGs during the next fifteen years is the establishment of the
#+index: High Level Political Forum
High Level Political Forum (HLPF), an annual review process in which
government ministers or, quadrennially, heads of state and government
meet to review evidence, share experiences, and deliberate on
appropriate policy responses. The principal objective of the
\index{High Level Political Forum} HLPF is to ensure ongoing and
high-level member-state attention to the effectiveness of policies
implemented, and other actions taken to improve progress towards the
established goals and targets.[fn:63] Ministerial meetings will take
place under the auspices of the
#+index: UN Economic and Social Council (EcoSoc)}
UN Economic and Social Council, a principal intergovernmental organ of
the United Nations; quadrennial meetings with heads of states and
governments will take place in the General Assembly. UN agencies,
funds, and programmes provide the needed data and reporting, and
support the UN Secretariat in accordance with their respective
mandates.

\index{Committee on World Food Security (CFS)|(}

Specialized intergovernmental review of food security and nutrition
issues can be provided by the Committee on World Food Security (CFS),
which has a mandate to do so, although it has given limited attention
to the full scope of nutrition issues in the past. Initially
established to enable member-state oversight of inter-agency action in
response to the food crisis of the early 1970s, the CFS was reformed
in 2009 to incorporate two new features: an Advisory Group was
established to enable the participation of non-state actors (among
others, civil society organizations, private sector and producer
organizations, non-governmental organizations, philanthropies, and
policy experts) in the CFS policy deliberations; and a scientific
advisory body, the \index{High Level Panel of Experts (HLPE)} High
Level Panel of Experts (HLPE), was established to review the state of
evidence and scientific thinking on key policy issues identified by
the CFS in its periodically revised Multi-Year Programme of Work. Most
of the staff and funding for the CFS Secretariat are provided by the
three Rome-based agencies (RBAs): the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for
#+INDEX: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
#+INDEX: International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
Agriculture Development (IFAD), and the World Food Programme
(WFP).\index{World Food Programme}

Today, the CFS is regarded by most experts as the state of the art in
global-level multistakeholder platforms, giving voice to a wide
variety of stakeholders and drawing on world-class scientific
expertise, while also leaving the final decision-making to the UN
member-states. According to sources closely involved in the CFS
reform, the decision to limit non-state actors to an advisory role was
strongly advocated by civil society as indispensable to ensuring
member-state ownership of, and accountability for, CFS policy guidance
and decisions citep:mckeon2014food. It is the combination of
structured access by non-state actors and ultimate member-state
ownership that accounts for the unique success of the CFS framework.

\index{Committee on World Food Security (CFS)|)}

A different type of multilateral framework frequently used in recent
\index{Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2)} decades,
and recommended in the ICN2 Rome Declaration, is the UN Decade of
\index{Rome Declaration} Action. The UN decades are often seen as
boondoggles, expensive and practically useless publicity or advocacy
exercises that are seldom supported by member-states, and which often
deflect high-level attention away from established programme
priorities. While there have been notorious failures in the past, more
recent experience has shown that well-targeted decadal programmes of
action, linked to widely shared developmental objectives, can help to
catalyse intergovernmental cooperation, and even generate emulation
and positive competition to improve results.

A UN Decade of Action on Nutrition for the years 2016--25 would serve
at least two vital purposes. (1) It would help to provide a unified,
cross-SDG focus on nutrition-related goals and targets within the new
post-2015 development framework. This is needed to ensure the salience
of nutrition as a key SDG objective in what is admittedly a crowded
field but one that has enormous potential for broad, concerted action
if there can be a mechanism to establish the necessary linkages among
complementary actions. (2) A UNGA declaration of such a
#+index: UN General Assembly
decade would also ensure that the UN Secretariat receives the
necessary directions to ensure adequate coordination of reporting, and
to demonstrate credible commitment to harmonized or coordinated
support at the global, regional, and country levels.

The costs of organizing and supporting a Decade of Action on Nutrition
need not be great, given that the essential requirements are not for
new institutions or resources for UN system coordination and support,
but rather for adapting and better use of /existing/ UN system
supports.  Three main mechanisms support the UN system action on
nutrition: the UN Standing Committee on Nutrition (SCN), an
inter-agency coordination mechanism established in 1977; the UN
\index{UN Standing Committee on Nutrition (SCN)} Secretary-General's
High Level Task Force on Global Food Security and Nutrition (HLTF),
#+INDEX: High Level Task Force on Global Food and Nutrition Security (HLTF)
which was formed in response to the food crises of 2008 and after; and
the SUN movement. \index{Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN)}

\index{UN Standing Committee on Nutrition (SCN)|(}

Established as a follow-up action to the 1974 World Food Conference to
“provide initiative in the development and harmonization of concepts,
policies and strategies and programmes in the United Nations system in
response to the nutritional needs of countries”,[fn:64] the SCN has
long been a critical support to inter-agency policy coordination, and
for many years provided one of the few sustained multistakeholder
platforms for nutrition citep:longhurst2010. In recent years, it has
been sharply criticized for not being able to adapt to changing
circumstances and constitute itself as a mechanism for enabling
sustained action at the country level; its multistakeholder platform,
which featured non-governmental and civil society organizations but
excluded private sector representatives, was also criticized as not
conducive to the broader alliance that some organizations and several
donors believe is critical to its success. The validity of such
criticisms is disputed within the nutrition community, particularly in
light of the current concerns about the need to establish robust
firewalls around policy processes related to nutrition. Yet it is also
clear that the SCN filled an important vacuum in enabling policy
coordination among UN organizations and helped to sustain a nutrition
focus across the UN system. It has a long-standing reporting
relationship to \index{UN Economic and Social Council (EcoSoc)} the UN
Economic and Social Council (EcoSoc), which had little practical
significance in the recent past but which can play a vital role in the
revamped SDG monitoring system that is currently being constructed by
member-states.

\index{UN Standing Committee on Nutrition (SCN)|)}

#+INDEX: High Level Task Force on Global Food and Nutrition Security (HLTF)
The HLTF consists of twenty-two UN agencies, funds and programmes, as
well as
#+INDEX: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
#+index: World Trade Organization (WTO)
It was initially formed to support advocacy and coordination of policy
guidance among participating organizations, and produced a set of
papers providing agreed policy and programmatic guidance, including a
Comprehensive Framework for Action that was twice revised. In 2013,
the principals \index{Zero Hunger Challenge|(}
#+INDEX: High Level Task Force on Global Food and Nutrition Security (HLTF)
adopted new HLTF terms of reference that called for the reorganization
of activity to support the Secretary-General's Zero Hunger Challenge
(ZHC). The guiding vision of the ZHC, first declared by the
Secretary-General in June 2012 at the United Nations Conference on
Sustainable Development (known as Rio+20), is organized around five
elements: 100 percent access to food at all times; zero stunting in
children under 2 years of age; making all food systems sustainable;
100 percent increase in rural producers' productivity and income; and
zero food loss and waste. These five elements are understood to be
interdependent, and achievement of the Zero Hunger vision will require
concerted action across a wide range of sectors. To highlight the
centrality of nutrition objectives, HLTF members added the words “and
Nutrition” to the official name of the HLTF in March 2015. Although
never officially endorsed by the UNGA, the five elements of the Zero
Hunger vision have been fully incorporated with modest amendment in
the SDGs, four under the targets for SDG 2 and the fifth under
#+INDEX: High Level Task Force on Global Food and Nutrition Security (HLTF)|(
SDG 12. The natural role of the HLTF is to build and coordinate broad
international support for the Zero Hunger elements as they have become
embedded in the new SDGs. The HLTF provides a natural bridge to a
wider set of institutions with important, but limited, programmatic
engagement in nutrition. The ZHC is also a convenient entry point for
building alliances with broad social and political movements to end
hunger, stop food loss and waste, and improve agricultural production
and rural livelihoods sustainably.
#+INDEX: High Level Task Force on Global Food and Nutrition Security (HLTF)|)

\index{Zero Hunger Challenge|)}

\index{Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN)|(}

During its first five years of existence, the SUN movement has
demonstrated great power to build a broad alliance of international
organizations committed to nutrition action. It has received strong
endorsement from the nutritionist (specialist) community, and
demonstrated a remarkable capacity for adaptation and innovation in
its organizational structure and working procedures. The large number
of country-members it has attracted is perhaps one of its most
remarkable achievements. Yet, the SUN's own commissioned, independent,
comprehensive evaluation concluded that the SUN movement had not yet
been able to demonstrate systematic success in achieving its objective
of scaling up nutrition action at the country level
(citealp:mokoro2015, p. 86.). This (early) result should not be
surprising, given the powerful forces at work constraining effective
nutrition action. But the limited effectiveness of SUN thus far does
suggest the need for putting in place supports and institutional
mechanisms that can sustain a global nutrition effort in the long
run. It also reminds us why the SUN, constituted as a movement, cannot
stand on its own as a central mechanism of global governance on
nutrition. For nutrition advocacy the SUN has no peers, but it lacks
the authority, legitimacy, and capacity for collective action that
only governments, acting individually and collectively, can
provide. And while the SUN's unique power comes from its distinctive
character as a movement, it is not, as a movement, constituted to
perform essential functions of governance: to prioritize choices,
regulate behaviour in the public interest, allocate and commit
resources, and accept accountability. The SUN is and will remain a
vital pillar of a growing international architecture that supports a
broad “system” of nutrition actors. But it is only one element of a
growing ecosystem that depends vitally on a UN system that acts as the
authoritative vehicle of collective action by nation-states.

\index{Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN)|)}

** Completing the reform

The core elements of a robust international system for nutrition are
now in place, but several important adjustments are
required. \index{UN Standing Committee on Nutrition (SCN)} The SCN
should be reformed, streamlining its functions by transferring its
role \index{Committee on World Food Security (CFS)} as a
multistakeholder platform to the CFS, and focusing more narrowly on
supporting and sustaining global nutrition policy work. Key functions
should include supporting inter-agency coordination and reporting on
nutrition in the new SDGs;
#+index: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
planning, coordinating, and sustaining a ten-year global plan of
action as a
#+index: Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2)
follow-up to ICN2; and supporting formulation of UN positions
on nutrition regulation
#+index: Committee on World Food Security (CFS)
through organs such as the CFS, WHA,
#+index: World Health Assembly
and \index{High Level Political Forum} HLPF. SCN participation should
be broadened \index{UN Standing Committee on Nutrition (SCN)|(} to
include the World Bank, among \index{World Bank} other major
international organizations with strong nutrition programmes. The SCN
should be sustained principally by contributions from participating
institutions, which may be supplemented by UN member-states'
contributions.

\index{UN Standing Committee on Nutrition (SCN)|)}

\index{Committee on World Food Security (CFS)|(}

The CFS, which has an existing but, until recently, underserved
mandate on nutrition, is expected to significantly expand its
nutrition work in the coming years. The monitoring and reporting
structures for the new SDGs have not yet been finalized, but it is
clear already that the CFS is likely to play an important role in the
expanded new framework for monitoring, analysing, and enabling
political dialogue and action toward achieving the new
SDGs. \index{Committee on World Food Security (CFS)|)} The UN Regional
Commissions will also have a larger role, coordinating data collection
and bottom-up monitoring and evaluation from the community,
provincial, and national levels to the regional level.

Summing up, the proposed adaptation of the global architecture for
nutrition governance builds on the coincidence of the launch of the
new SDGs and the launch of a multi-year programme of action for
nutrition to energize a broad, powerful, dynamic, and accountable
member-state-owned system for enabling coordinated action at all
levels. The reformed architecture also ensures compliance with
intergovernmentally agreed norms and standards, including norms
related to conflicts of interest, and provides for adequate and timely
monitoring of outcomes and performance at all levels. It ensures a
truly comprehensive and inclusive system for nutrition monitoring, and
provides strong peer accountability for motivating effective
action. It expands opportunities for meaningful participation of civil
society and private sector organizations in the development of norms,
standards, and policy guidance. By providing a universally relevant
nutrition agenda that covers all three dimensions of malnutrition --
undernourishment, micronutrient deficiencies, and obesity and other
diet-related non-communicable diseases -- it mainstreams nutrition
concerns. Further, it secures nutrition as a principal driver for the
full fifteen-year cycle of the next-generation global development
agenda.

The critical test of this new, or for that matter any, institutional
framework on nutrition is whether or not it contributes to overcoming
the main sources of friction, fragmentation, and dissolution that have
plagued nutrition actions in the past. The new nutrition architecture
addresses several of these issues by ensuring that a comprehensive
nutrition agenda will be constantly measured and
monitored. Governments are more likely to be compelled by the pressure
on their reputations that comes from constant reporting of successes
and failures, than by the always limited political pressure of
accountability to the poor and vulnerable who constitute the majority
of those suffering most from all aspects of undernutrition. While the
new architecture cannot guarantee the mobilization of adequate human
and financial resources, it does ensure that commitment and support
for nutrition will be prolonged and relentless. If it is fully
energized by a declared decade of coordinated action, the architecture
can make the UN system achieve its nutrition goals. But for that to
happen, changes are required in the way the UN perceives and executes
its own role in enabling an ecosystem of actors and institutions to
flourish.

** Recasting the UN's role

\index{United Nations|(}

Thus far we have directed our discussion to the key role that
multilateral institutions can play in establishing a milieu for
sustained effective action on nutrition. This should not lead us to
expect that such an enabling environment can be supplied by the UN
system alone. The material, scientific, technical, organizational,
educational, political, technological, and financial resources to
address malnutrition are far beyond the resources of UN agencies,
funds, and programmes. Still, the UN has a vital and unique role to
play as an enabler of others' actions in this field.

The UN has impressive, if not always well-utilized, capacity to
facilitate others' policy actions. For example, by enabling the
development and promulgation of regulations for food safety through
institutions such as the \index{Codex Alimentarius} Codex
Alimentarius, the international food standards body jointly supported
by the FAO and WHO, \index{World Health Organization (WHO)} the UN can
influence private business practices and encourage innovation in food
products and services, including food storage and handling, reductions
in food loss and waste, and improvements in the nutritional quality of
commercial food products. Developing and improving a food systems
approach to nutrition, as advocated in the ICN2 Framework for Action,
\index{ICN2 Framework for Action} is inconceivable unless the agenda
is fully accepted by the private sector as essential to its own
long-term health and prosperity. The UN has an important role to play
in supporting the member-states' efforts to develop rules and
regulations for an appropriate enabling environment for the
functioning of food systems for nutrition. Similarly, while the UN
cannot claim to be a leading global centre for research on nutrition,
it has an important role to play in bringing the best experience and
research to the attention of key policymakers to whom it has
privileged access under its own auspices.

Because many different kinds of social actors are required to
accelerate momentum on nutrition action, it is frequently argued,
erroneously in our view, that UN institutions should take a more
limited view of their role and accept a position as one of many equal
partners in development, with no more right to claim priority for
their views than any other institution. The same line of thinking
leads to a /laissez faire/ or “anything goes” attitude toward
partnerships; we need action, it is often said, and we don’t have time
for UN deliberations to decide what needs to be done. Let those who
can, and want to, contribute do so, and let the beneficiary countries
decide what is most helpful for them.

Such views, to a large extent, are misguided. If widely adopted, they
will sooner than later undermine the potential for genuine
multistakeholder partnership that exists in many areas of nutrition
action today. They will undermine confidence that these partnerships
are guided by a genuine public interest. They will also undermine it
by limiting what is put on offer to what the providers themselves want
to offer; which leads to a reduced set of choices and an impoverished
dialogue between development partners and their
beneficiaries. Finally, such misguided views will discourage UN bodies
from playing important regulatory and governance roles that only
legitimate multilateral organizations can play to establish effective
cooperation among the vast array of institutions involved in nutrition
today.

Today, a heated debate surrounds the role of alliances or partnerships
with the private sector and other non-state actors in achieving
development outcomes. In the area of nutrition, four issues stand
out. First, how are these non-state actors to be made accountable to
the host or beneficiary nations? The current vogue is for promoting
beneficiary country accountability to international actors -- donors,
CSOs and NGOs, and private sector entities -- but not the other way
round. Mutual accountability, the catch-phrase of international
political correctness, has little practical meaning in these
contexts. Too often, the effort is to make the recipient country's
processes and expenditures fully transparent, but reporting by
intentional actors, if it exists at all, to host governments is
comparatively limited. In such circumstances, the international
presence also works to undermine governmental authority and capacity
by establishing institutions that operate parallel to local and even
national governments, and compete with them for resources and talent.

\index{private sector engagement}

Secondly, the question of how to engage with the private sector is
particularly acute. Given the well-known history of interference in
national and international regulatory bodies, there is a need for
strong and credible protections against conflicts of interest, but few
public--private partnerships take this responsibility seriously, and
action on this front is usually limited to a memorandum of
understanding without practical or legal effect, and with limited, if
any, investment in monitoring and enforcement. In the context of the
extreme asymmetries of power, information, and resources that exist
between many developing countries and large multinational
corporations, there is clear need for a neutral third party to help
define -- and monitor and enforce -- the clear rules of the game. This
is in the best interests of both the developing countries and the
large corporate entities, who need help with setting the boundaries of
acceptable behaviour where individuals from both the private and
public sides too easily pursue private ends that undermine public
policy and trust in public institutions.

A third area of contention surrounds the need for enabling developing
countries' governments to play a meaningful role in deciding what
policy objectives and means of support should be prioritized. The
private sector and non-state actors are less likely to offer what
developing countries need if decisions are all made on the supply
side; intergovernmental processes where donors and beneficiaries meet
to assess needs offer the most balanced, if not always satisfying,
forums for defining and matching needs and responses, developing
appropriate policy guidance, and mobilizing financial and other means
of implementation.

Finally, there is the matter of accountability. Developing countries
complain that efforts to shift the discussion of development
partnership from intergovernmental processes to public--private
partnerships lead to much weaker forms of mutual accountability than
the admittedly challenged multilateral processes. Intergovernmental
forums, and the agreements produced in them, typically lead to
institutionalized monitoring and reporting of follow-up actions,
unlike pledges, memoranda of understanding, and other such
transactions with non-state actors. Private sector investment pledges
are seldom followed through, and there is, in any case, rarely any
mechanism for follow-up tracking and reporting.

\index{private sector engagement}

To address these issues, there are at least four important functions
and roles that UN institutions are uniquely called on to play at
regional and country levels, which cannot be played by other
international actors either at all or as well: (1) developing -- and
monitoring and ensuring compliance with -- intergovernmentally agreed
norms, including voluntary guidelines and conflict of interest rules;
(2) providing a critical but informed forum for discussion of key
policy issues and development of internationally agreed guidance,
enabling mutual learning, often through South--South cooperation; (3)
providing global data standards to enable consistent and comparable
monitoring of progress; and (4) serving as a neutral broker for
information and expertise. The unique status of UN institutions in
their accountability to the member-states is decisive for enabling the
UN to fulfil each of these functions.

To be truly effective in enabling action by others, each of these
functions must be performed so that they are trusted not only by host
governments, but also by the vast array of international partners
offering their own services and supports. But here lies a dilemma. For
all UN institutions, establishing and maintaining an important ground
presence requires reliance not only on the goodwill of host
governments, but also on the support of public and, increasingly,
private donors. To this extent, multilateral institutions inevitably
find themselves in a competitive situation with the other actors whose
nutrition actions they hope to regulate through moral suasion, and
with one another. To this extent, they stand as one more donor
supplicant in the highly competitive "aid industry".

What can be done to preserve the integrity of multilateral
institutions and ensure that their country-level presence is genuinely
guided by the interests of the host government? The answer is
disarmingly simple: ensure accountability through an intergovernmental
process. In the end, this is what distinguishes true multilateral
partnership from other forms of partnership based principally on
like-mindedness, mutual interest or mere convenience. The reason that
accountability to an intergovernmental process matters is that it is
so far the only reliable guarantee for a developing country to ensure
that it can freely decide, albeit in often complex and challenging
circumstances, a course for itself. The outcomes of multilateral
processes are full of compromises. But they are the most reasonable
outcomes attainable for enabling countries to plot their own
development pathways. Multilateral processes are time-consuming and
difficult precisely because much is at stake, particularly for the
developing countries. Put simply, it is in a multilateral system that
developing countries have a real say and where they feel an obligation
to comply with agreed commitments. That is why the temptation to
bypass such processes will possibly lead to occasional short-term
successes, but also, more often than not, to general failure.

An effective system for governance of global nutrition action must be
deeply rooted in the norms, member-state agreements, and institutional
architecture of the UN system.

\noindent /Welcoming the participation of Heads of State and
Government and other high-level guests/,

1. We, Ministers and Representatives of the Members of the Food and
   Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World
   Health Organization (WHO), assembled at the Second International
   Conference on Nutrition in Rome from 19 to 21 November 2014,
   jointly organized by FAO and WHO, to address the multiple
   challenges of malnutrition in all its forms and identify
   opportunities for tackling them in the next decades.

2. Reaffirming the commitments made at the first International
   Conference on Nutrition in 1992, and the World Food Summits in 1996
   and 2002 and the World Summit on Food Security in 2009, as well as
   in relevant international targets and action plans, including the
   WHO 2025 Global Nutrition Targets and the WHO Global Action Plan
   for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases
   2013-2020.

3. Reaffirming the right of everyone to have access to safe,
   sufficient, and nutritious food, consistent with the right to
   adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from
   hunger consistent with the International Covenant on Economic,
   Social and Cultural Rights and other relevant United Nations
   instruments.

**** /Multiple challenges of malnutrition to inclusive and sustainable development and to health/

4. [@4]Acknowledge that malnutrition, in all its forms, including
   undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity,
   not only affects people’s health and wellbeing by impacting
   negatively on human physical and cognitive development,
   compromising the immune system, increasing susceptibility to
   communicable and noncommunicable diseases, restricting the
   attainment of human potential and reducing productivity, but also
   poses a high burden in the form of negative social and economic
   consequences to individuals, families, communities and States.

5. Recognize that the root causes of and factors leading to
   malnutrition are complex and multidimensional:

   a) poverty, underdevelopment and low socio-economic status are
      major contributors to malnutrition in both rural and urban
      areas;

   b) the lack of access at all times to sufficient food, which is
      adequate both in quantity and quality which conforms with the
      beliefs, culture, traditions, dietary habits and preferences of
      individuals in accordance with national and international laws
      and obligations;

   c) malnutrition is often aggravated by poor infant and young child
      feeding and care practices, poor sanitation and hygiene, lack of
      access to education, quality health systems and safe drinking
      water, foodborne infections and parasitic infestations,
      ingestion of harmful levels of contaminants due to unsafe food
      from production to consumption;

   d) epidemics, such as of the Ebola virus disease, pose tremendous
      challenges to food security and nutrition.

6. Acknowledge that different forms of malnutrition co-exist within
   most countries; while dietary risk affects all socio-economic
   groups, large inequalities exist in nutritional status, exposure to
   risk and adequacy of dietary energy and nutrient intake, between
   and within countries.

7. Recognize that some socioeconomic and environmental changes can
   have an impact on dietary and physical activity patterns, leading
   to higher susceptibility to obesity and noncommunicable diseases
   through increasing sedentary lifestyles and consumption of food
   that is high in fat, especially saturated and trans-fats, sugars,
   and salt/sodium.

8. Recognize the need to address the impacts of climate change and
   other environmental factors on food security and nutrition, in
   particular on the quantity, quality and diversity of food produced,
   taking appropriate action to tackle negative effects.

9. Recognize that conflict and post conflict situations, humanitarian
   emergencies and protracted crises, including, /inter alia/, droughts,
   floods and desertification as well as pandemics, hinder food
   security and nutrition.

10. Acknowledge that current food systems are being increasingly
    challenged to provide adequate, safe, diversified and nutrient
    rich food for all that contribute to healthy diets due to, inter
    alia, constraints posed by resource scarcity and environmental
    degradation, as well as by unsustainable production and
    consumption patterns, food losses and waste, and unbalanced
    distribution.

11. Acknowledge that trade is a key element in achieving food security
    and nutrition and that trade policies are to be conducive to
    fostering food security and nutrition for all, through a fair and
    market-oriented world trade system, and reaffirm the need to
    refrain from unilateral measures not in accordance with
    international law, including the Charter of the United Nations,
    and which endanger food security and nutrition, as stated in the
    1996 Rome Declaration.

12. Note with profound concern that, notwithstanding significant
    achievements in many countries, recent decades have seen modest
    and uneven progress in reducing malnutrition and estimated figures
    show that:

    a) the prevalence of undernourishment has moderately declined, but
       absolute numbers remain unacceptably high with an estimated 805
       million people suffering chronically from hunger in 2012--2014;

    b) chronic malnutrition as measured by stunting has declined, but
       in 2013 still affected 161 million children under five years of
       age, while acute malnutrition (wasting) affected 51 million
       children under five years of age;

    c) undernutrition was the main underlying cause of death in
       children under five, causing 45% of all child deaths in the
       world in 2013;

    d) over two billion people suffer from micronutrient deficiencies,
       in particular vitamin A, iodine, iron and zinc, among others;

    e) overweight and obesity among both children and adults have been
       increasing rapidly in all regions, with 42 million children
       under five years of age affected by overweight in 2013 and over
       500 million adults affected by obesity in 2010;

    f) dietary risk factors, together with inadequate physical
       activity, account for almost 10% of the global burden of
       disease and disability.

**** /A common vision for global action to end all forms of malnutrition/

13. [@13]We reaffirm that:

   a) the elimination of malnutrition in all its forms is an
      imperative for health, ethical, political, social and economic
      reasons, paying particular attention to the special needs of
      children, women, the elderly, persons with disabilities, other
      vulnerable groups as well as people in humanitarian emergencies;

   b) nutrition policies should promote a diversified, balanced and
      healthy diet at all stages of life. In particular, special
      attention should be given to the first 1,000 days, from the
      start of pregnancy to two years of age, pregnant and lactating
      women, women of reproductive age, and adolescent girls, by
      promoting and supporting adequate care and feeding practices,
      including exclusive breast feeding during the first six months,
      and continued breastfeeding until two years of age and beyond
      with appropriate complementary feeding. Healthy diets should be
      fostered in preschools, schools, public institutions, at the
      workplace and at home, as well as healthy eating by families;

   c) coordinated action among different actors, across all relevant
      sectors at international, regional, national and community
      levels, needs to be supported through cross-cutting and coherent
      policies, programmes and initiatives, including social
      protection, to address the multiple burdens of malnutrition and
      to promote sustainable food systems;

   d) food should not be used as an instrument for political or
      economic pressure;

   e) excessive volatility of prices of food and agricultural
      commodities can negatively impact food security and nutrition,
      and needs to be better monitored and addressed for the
      challenges it poses;

   f) improvements in diet and nutrition require relevant legislative
      frameworks for food safety and quality, including for the proper
      use of agrochemicals, by promoting participation in the
      activities of the Codex Alimentarius Commission for the
      development of international standards for food safety and
      quality, as well as for improving information for consumers,
      while avoiding inappropriate marketing and publicity of foods
      and non-alcoholic beverages to children, as recommended by
      resolution WHA63.14;

   g) nutrition data and indicators, as well as the capacity of, and
      support to all countries, especially developing countries, for
      data collection and analysis, need to be improved in order to
      contribute to more effective nutrition surveillance, policy
      making and accountability;

   h) empowerment of consumers is necessary through improved and
      evidence-based health and nutrition information and education to
      make informed choices regarding consumption of food products for
      healthy dietary practices;

   i) national health systems should integrate nutrition while
      providing access for all to integrated health services through a
      continuum of care approach, including health promotion and
      disease prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, and contribute
      to reducing inequalities through addressing specific
      nutrition-related needs and vulnerabilities of different
      population groups;

   j) nutrition and other related policies should pay special
      attention to women and empower women and girls, thereby
      contributing to women’s full and equal access to social
      protection and resources, including, /inter alia/, income, land,
      water, finance, education, training, science and technology, and
      health services, thus promoting food security and health.

14. We recognize that:

   a) international cooperation and Official Development Assistance
      for nutrition should support and complement national nutrition
      strategies, policies and programmes, and surveillance
      initiatives, as appropriate;

   b) the progressive realization of the right to adequate food in the
      context of national food security is fostered through
      sustainable, equitable, accessible in all cases, and resilient
      and diverse food systems;

   c) collective action is instrumental to improve nutrition,
      requiring collaboration between governments, the private sector,
      civil society and communities;

   d) non-discriminatory and secure access and utilization of
      resources in accordance with international law are important for
      food security and nutrition;

   e) food and agriculture systems, including crops, livestock,
      forestry, fisheries and aquaculture, need to be addressed
      comprehensively through coordinated public policies, taking into
      account the resources, investment, environment, people,
      institutions and processes with which food is produced,
      processed, stored, distributed, prepared and consumed;

   f) family farmers and small holders, notably women farmers, play an
      important role in reducing malnutrition and should be supported
      by integrated and multisectoral public policies, as appropriate,
      that raise their productive capacity and incomes and strengthen
      their resilience;

   g) wars, occupations, terrorism, civil disturbances and natural
      disasters, disease outbreaks and epidemics, as well as human
      rights violations and inappropriate socio-economic policies,
      have resulted in tens of millions of refugees, displaced
      persons, war affected non-combatant civilian populations and
      migrants, who are among the most nutritionally vulnerable
      groups. Resources for rehabilitating and caring for these groups
      are often extremely inadequate and nutritional deficiencies are
      common. All responsible parties should cooperate to ensure the
      safe and timely passage and distribution of food and medical
      supplies to those in need, which conforms with the beliefs,
      culture, traditions, dietary habits and preferences of
      individuals, in accordance with national legislation and
      international law and obligations and the Charter of the United
      Nations;

   h) responsible investment in agriculture[fn:27], including small
      holders and family farming and in food systems, is essential for
      overcoming malnutrition;

   i) governments should protect consumers, especially children, from
      inappropriate marketing and publicity of food;

   j) nutrition improvement requires healthy, balanced, diversified
      diets, including traditional diets where appropriate, meeting
      nutrient requirements of all age groups, and all groups with
      special nutrition needs, while avoiding the excessive intake of
      saturated fat, sugars and salt/sodium, and virtually eliminating
      trans-fat, among others;

   k) food systems should provide year-round access to foods that
      cover people’s nutrient needs and promote healthy dietary
      practices;

   l) food systems need to contribute to preventing and addressing
      infectious diseases, including zoonotic diseases, and tackling
      antimicrobial resistance;

   m) food systems, including all components of production, processing
      and distribution should be sustainable, resilient and efficient
      in providing more diverse foods in an equitable manner, with due
      attention to assessing environmental and health impacts;

   n) food losses and waste throughout the food chain should be
      reduced in order to contribute to food security, nutrition, and
      sustainable development;

   o) the United Nations system, including the Committee on World Food
      Security, and international and regional financial institutions
      should work more effectively together in order to support
      national and regional efforts, as appropriate, and enhance
      international cooperation and development assistance to
      accelerate progress in addressing malnutrition;

   p) EXPO MILANO 2015, dedicated to “feeding the planet, energy for
      life”, among other relevant events and fora, will provide an
      opportunity to stress the importance of food security and
      nutrition, raise public awareness, foster debate, and give
      visibility to the ICN2 outcomes.

**** /Commitment to action/

15. [@15]We commit to:

16. [@16]We call on FAO and WHO, in collaboration with other United Nations
    agencies, funds and programmes, as well as other international
    organizations, to support national governments, upon request, in
    developing, strengthening and implementing their policies,
    programmes and plans to address the multiple challenges of
    malnutrition.

17. We recommend to the United Nations General Assembly to endorse the
    Rome Declaration on Nutrition, as well as the Framework for Action
    which provides a set of voluntary policy options and strategies
    for use by governments, as appropriate, and to consider declaring
    a Decade of Action on Nutrition from 2016 to 2025 within existing
    structures and available resources.

\centerline{\bfseries FROM COMMITMENTS TO ACTION}

*** Background

1. There has been a significant improvement in reducing hunger and
   malnutrition of the world’s population since the 1992 International
   Conference on Nutrition (ICN). Yet, progress in reducing hunger and
   undernutrition has been uneven and unacceptably slow. The
   fundamental challenge today is to sustainably improve nutrition
   through implementation of coherent policies and better coordinated
   actions across all relevant sectors.

*** Purpose and targets

2. [@2]The nature of this Framework for Action is voluntary. Its purpose
   is to guide the implementation of the commitments of the Rome
   Declaration on Nutrition adopted by the Second International
   Conference on Nutrition held in Rome, Italy, on 19--21
   November 2014. Building on existing commitments, goals and targets,
   this Framework for Action provides a set of policy options and
   strategies which governments[fn:28], acting in cooperation with
   other stakeholders, may incorporate, as appropriate, into their
   national nutrition, health, agriculture[fn:29], development and
   investment plans, and consider in negotiating international
   agreements to achieve better nutrition for all.

3. As governments have primary responsibility for taking action at
   country level, in dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders,
   including affected communities, the recommendations are principally
   addressed to government leaders. They will consider the
   appropriateness of the recommended policies and actions in relation
   to national needs and conditions, as well as regional and national
   priorities, including in legal frameworks. For the purpose of
   accountability, this Framework for Action adopts existing global
   targets for improving maternal, infant and young child
   nutrition[fn:30] and for noncommunicable disease risk factor
   reduction[fn:31] to be achieved by 2025.

The Framework for Action (FFA) provides a set of voluntary policy
options and strategies -- in the form of 60 recommended actions -- for
use primarily by governments as well as other stakeholders, as
appropriate, to guide the implementation of the political declaration.

This Information Note, prepared by the joint FAO and WHO Secretariat,
is intended to accompany the FFA, and provides additional information
that may be helpful to Member States and other stakeholders. For ease
of reference, the document follows the structure of the FFA.

**** 1.1 Background

There has been significant progress in reducing hunger and
undernutrition since the 1992 International Conference on Nutrition
(ICN), but progress has been uneven and unacceptably slow. The
prevalence of those suffering from chronic dietary energy
insufficiency has declined, but remains unacceptably high, with over
800 million people suffering from chronic undernourishment, mainly in
South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Chronic malnutrition (stunting) still affects 161 million children
under 5 years of age, while acute malnutrition (wasting) affects 51
million children under 5 years of age. In addition, over two billion
people suffer from one or more micronutrient deficiencies.

Furthermore, alongside the problems of chronic undernourishment
(hunger), undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies (also referred
to as ‘hidden hunger’), most countries in the world are also facing
increasing problems associated with obesity and diet-related
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Over half a billion adults are obese
and 42 million children under 5 years of age are overweight while
diet-related NCDs are becoming serious global public health problems
even in low- and middle-income countries, creating the “multiple
burden” of malnutrition (hunger/undernutrition; micronutrient
deficiencies; obesity and diet-related NCDs).

Meanwhile, the food system has continued to evolve with a greater
proportion of food now processed and traded internationally. The
availability of highly-processed commercial food products high in fat,
sugars and salt/sodium has increased, often replacing healthy local
diets and foods with the needed micronutrients, and resulting in
excessive consumption of energy, fats, sugars and salt. The
fundamental challenge today is to sustainably improve nutrition
through implementation of coherent policies and better coordinated
actions across all relevant sectors, strengthening, preserving and
recovering healthy and sustainable food systems.

**** 1.2 Purpose and Targets

The nature of this Framework for Action is voluntary. The purpose of
the FFA is to guide implementation of the commitments of the Rome
Declaration on Nutrition adopted by the Second International
Conference on Nutrition held in Rome, Italy, on 19--21
November 2014. Building on existing commitments, goals and targets,
the FFA provides a set of policy options and strategies which
governments (including the European Union and other regional
organizations on matters of their competency), acting in cooperation
with other stakeholders, may incorporate, as appropriate, into their
national nutrition, health, agriculture,[fn:41] education, development
and investment plans, and consider in negotiating international
agreements to achieve better nutrition for all.

As governments have primary responsibility for taking action at
country level, in dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders,
including affected communities, the recommendations are principally
addressed to government leaders. They will consider the
appropriateness of the recommended policies and actions in relation to
national and local needs and conditions, as well as national and
regional priorities, including in legal frameworks. For the purpose of
accountability, this FFA also adopts existing global targets for
improving maternal, infant and young child nutrition[fn:42] and for
NCD risk factor reduction[fn:43] to be achieved by 2025.

**** 2. CREATING AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR EFFECTIVE ACTION

Following the 1992 ICN, many countries developed and implemented
national nutrition strategies and action plans, reflecting their own
priorities and strategies for alleviating hunger and malnutrition in
all its forms. However, implementation and progress have been patchy
and often unsatisfactory due to inadequate commitment and leadership,
lack of financial investments, weak human and institutional capacities
and lack of appropriate accountability mechanisms.

Actions to address malnutrition in all its forms are among the most
cost-effective for development, providing very high economic
returns. The potential human, societal and economic gains from turning
the commitments of the Rome Declaration on Nutrition into action are
substantial, while the costs of inaction are high. Available resources
should be used to implement and scale up the most appropriate,
cost-effective, evidence-based, nutrition interventions. This often
requires complementary investments in other related sectors including
food and agriculture, health, education, water, sanitation and
hygiene, as well as trade.

Fulfilling the human right to food and fighting malnutrition in all
its forms requires a sustained enabling policy environment and
improved governance mechanisms for food, health and related
systems. Key requirements for the establishment of such enabling
environment and improved governance mechanisms are:

+ political commitment and leadership to prioritize structural,
  sustainable and equitable nutrition-enhancing approaches and strong
  national nutrition governance;

+ adoption of effective and coherent policies, strategies and
  programmes, and effective multisectoral cooperation mechanisms, to
  address the structural determinants and causes of malnutrition, and
  its effects;

+ increased and better aligned public and private investments in
  support of established nutrition goals;

+ enhanced and sustained human and institutional capacities for
  effective action, including policy and programme design, management,
  monitoring and evaluation of nutrition outcomes and investments;

+ allocation of national and international resources to ensure healthy
  diets for all, with special focus on the most nutritionally
  vulnerable life stages and specific dietary needs;

+ engagement of trusted and trusting partners ready to align
  interests, and to create and sustain inclusive interaction;

+ regular and systematic public assessments of progress to enhance
  accountability and effectiveness, and to improve resource use;

+ international support for the implementation of national
  nutrition policies and programmes, as appropriate, and
  nutrition-sensitive approaches agreed at international level.

**** 3. POLICY AND PROGRAMME OPTIONS TO IMPROVE NUTRITION IN ALL SECTORS

Addressing malnutrition in all its forms is strengthened by a common
vision and a multisectoral approach that includes coordinated,
coherent, equitable and complementary interventions[fn:44] in food systems
and agriculture,[fn:45] health, social protection, education and trade among
others, and by addressing not only hunger and undernutrition, but also
the multiple burden of malnutrition efficiently and innovatively.

**** 3.1 Sustainable Food Systems Promoting Healthy Diets[fn:46]
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: 3.1 Sustainable food systems promoting healthy diets
:END:

The types of foods produced and how they are processed, traded,
retailed and marketed through the supply chain impact the collective
surroundings, opportunities and conditions that influence people’s
food and beverage choices and dietary practices and consequently,
their nutritional status.  Information and education concerning
dietary practices are vital, but consumers must also be empowered
through enabling food environments.[fn:47] Food environments that
provide safe, diverse and healthy diets are particularly important for
vulnerable groups, who are more constrained by lack of resources.

A food system approach -- from production to processing, storage,
transportation, marketing, retailing and consumption -- is thus key to
promote healthy diet and improve nutrition as isolated interventions
have limited impact.

Since food systems have become increasingly complex and strongly
influence people’s ability to consume healthy diets, coherent action
and innovative food system solutions are needed tability to consume healthy diets, coherent action
and innovative food system solutions are needed to ensure access to
sustainable, balanced and healthy diets for all. These solutions
should include production, availability, accessibility and
affordability of a variety of cereals, legumes, vegetables, fruits and
animal source foods, including fish, meat, eggs and dairy products;
diets containing adequate macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats and
protein), fibre and essential micronutrients (vitamins and minerals)
in line with WHO recommendations on healthy diet, and produced and
consumed sustainably. On the other hand, these solutions should
include measures to restrict the production, availability,
accessibility and promotion of food products leading to excessive
intake of energy, fats, sugars and salt/sodium.

Globally, the food system contains a diverse mix of traditional and
modern supply chains. Both offer risks and opportunities for
nutrition. Low-income consumers in low and middle income countries
have a greater tendency to buy food via traditional supply chains,
where losses are high, and safety and quality control are
limited. Modern processing and retailing offer more fruits, vegetables
and animal-source foods through cold chain storage, and contribute to
improved food quality and safety, but highly processed foods of low
nutritional value contribute to rising obesity and diet-related NCDs.

Investing in rural populations is vital for equitable human
development. Subsistence and family farmers, most of whom are women,
and often lack access to and control of critical inputs and markets,
can be more effectively engaged to meet local nutrition needs, while
commercial producers are critical to stabilizing global supply and
prices, and to applying sustainable practices at scale.

Raising women’s incomes brings great health and nutrition benefits as
often women manage household resources and greatly influence household
food consumption, in particular of infants and young
children. Improving agriculture and food technology gives women more
time, improves their incomes and nutrition, and generally enhances
their well-being as well as their infants and young children. It is
also important to increase women’s control over resources such as
income, land, agricultural inputs and technology.

Natural and manmade disasters, emergencies, conflicts and shocks have
increased in recent years, in both frequency and intensity. Resilience
is necessary to prevent further deterioration of the nutritional
status of crisis-affected populations, while nutrition is critical to
strengthening both community and individual resilience. Resilience
requires that preventive and curative interventions to address the
underlying causes of malnutrition are implemented before, during and
after crises.

Climate change affects production and productivity, and this directly
affects diets and nutrition, smallholder farmer[fn:48] incomes, as
well as food price volatility. Food systems themselves have a major
impact on the environment.[fn:49] Some food production systems have
the potential to reduce emissions intensity significantly. Food loss
and waste should be reduced to

recommended actions for sustainable food systems promoting healthy
diets (Recommendations 8--16):

#+attr_latex: :options [leftmargin=*]
+ Recommendation 8: Review national policies and investments and
  integrate nutrition objectives into food and agriculture policy,
  programme design and implementation, to enhance nutrition sensitive
  agriculture, ensure food security and enable healthy diets.

+ Recommendation 9: Strengthen local food production and processing,
  especially by smallholder and family farmers, giving special attention
  to women’s empowerment, while recognizing that efficient and effective
  trade is key to achieving nutrition objectives.

+ Recommendation 10: Promote the diversification of crops including
  underutilized traditional crops, more production of fruits and
  vegetables, and appropriate production of animal-source products as
  needed, applying sustainable food production and natural resource
  management practices.

+ Recommendation 11: Improve storage, preservation, transport and
  distribution technologies and infrastructure to reduce seasonal food
  insecurity, food and nutrient loss and waste.

+ Recommendation 12: Establish and strengthen institutions, policies,
  programmes and services to enhance the resilience of the food supply
  in crisis-prone areas, including areas affected by climate change.

+ Recommendation 13: Develop, adopt and adapt, where appropriate,
  international guidelines on healthy diets.

+ Recommendation 14: Encourage gradual reduction of saturated fat,
  sugars and salt/sodium and trans-fat from foods and beverages to
  prevent excessive intake by consumers and improve nutrient content
  of foods, as needed.

+ Recommendation 15: Explore regulatory and voluntary instruments --
  such as marketing, publicity and labelling policies, economic
  incentives or disincentives in accordance with Codex Alimentarius
  and World Trade Organization rules -- to promote healthy diets.

+ Recommendation 16: Establish food or nutrient-based standards to
  make healthy diets and safe drinking water accessible in public
  facilities such as hospitals, childcare facilities, workplaces,
  universities, schools, food and catering services, government
  offices and prisons, and encourage the establishment of facilities
  for breastfeeding.

\noindent improve food system efficacy and sustainability. There is an
urgent need, therefore, to develop more sustainable food systems by
encouraging sustainable food production and consumption
practices. Agreement on shared principles of sustainability in
promoting healthy diets is needed, and this will require policy
coherence among the environment, agriculture and food sectors.

**** 3.2 International Trade and Investment

Trade and investment have become increasingly important to food
systems. Trade and investment agreements affect how the food system
functions at global, regional, national and local levels, influencing
food prices, availability, access and consumption as well as nutrition
outcomes, food safety and dietary options.

Coherence between trade and nutrition policy is vital. Trade policy
should support and provide adequate flexibility to implement effective
nutrition policies and programmes. While trade has substantially
increased the availability of and sometimes access to food for people,
trade policies and agreements should not negatively impact the human
right to food. Implementation of the World Trade Organization
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
should be supportive of food security and nutrition, and the
obligation of Member States to promote, realize and protect the human
right to food. The recommendations of Codex Alimentarius are also key
for ensuring that international trade respects and promotes health and
nutrition.

**** 3.3 Nutrition Education[fn:50] and Information
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: 3.3 Nutrition education and information
:END:

Knowledge and education empower people to make informed healthy
dietary and lifestyle choices, to improve infant and young child
feeding practices and care, and to improve hygiene and health
promoting behaviour. Lifestyle and behaviour change is an important
objective of nutrition education. It can also help reduce food losses
and waste and boost sustainable resource use.

Governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the private sector
and nutrition advocates should lead by example and can help promote
desired healthy lifestyle changes, including through active and
accessible quality health and agricultural inputs and services, food
and nutrition knowledge and skills included in primary and secondary
school curricula (including teaching hygiene, food preparation and
culinary practices in schools), public nutrition information, social
marketing campaigns, and regulations on nutrient and health claims.

Health services should be more active in nutrition education; dietary
counselling should be part of primary health care, and nutrition
counselling part of health workers’ training. Pre-natal and post-natal
dietary counselling can significantly improve maternal and child
nutrition. Adolescent girls and women in particular will benefit from
better nutrition education to promote exclusive breastfeeding in the
first six months of life and appropriate infant and young child
feeding. Educational outreach should extend to husbands, fathers and
other caregivers.

People should be informed of the nutritional content of food and meals
at the time of purchase through easy-to-understand nutrition
labels. Regulations on nutrient and health claims are also needed to
safeguard consumers.

**** 3.4 Social Protection

In 2012, the UN General Assembly recommended comprehensive universal
social protection beginning with basic or minimum ‘social protection
floors’. Given the limited and uneven progress in reducing poverty,
hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition, and the currently dim
prospects for economic and employment growth in much of the world,
comprehensive social protection is needed to eliminate poverty and
malnutrition in all its forms.

Social protection measures, such as food distribution, cash transfers,
decent job creation and school feeding, can increase incomes and
strengthen resilience. When combined with relevant health services,
well-designed social protection programmes result in improved height,
reduced anaemia, increased dietary diversity, and raised consumption
of nutrient-dense foods, especially in low-income households with
infants and children.

These measures can substantially enhance small producer resilience by
preventing destitution in times of crisis besides raising production
and productivity, both on- and off-farm, taking into account local
contexts and market capabilities.

  adequate for healthy diets.

**** 3.5 Strong and Resilient Health Systems

Health systems are increasingly challenged to tackle the evolving
needs presented by the multiple forms of malnutrition and their health
consequences. Strong health systems are needed to prevent and treat
malnutrition in all its forms through the delivery of
evidence-informed nutrition interventions, as well as to prevent and
treat recurrent infections which can aggravate undernutrition. In
addition, health systems also have to deal with the long-term health
consequences associated with overweight and obesity, and the
prevention and control of diet-related NCDs.

Effective delivery of direct nutrition interventions as well as
prevention and treatment of diseases which can aggravate nutrition
problems require strong and resilient national health systems. Health
systems need to be linked to and coherent with food systems, and both
need to strive for equity and the full realization of the right to
enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health
and the right to food.

Access to health services and financial risk protection for all --
including the most marginalized and most vulnerable -- is needed. This
means universal health coverage (UHC), which implies that all people
have access, without discrimination, to nationally determined sets of
the needed promotive, preventive, curative, palliative and
rehabilitative essential health services and essential, safe,
affordable, effective and quality medicines, while ensuring that the
use of these services does not expose the users to financial hardship
with a special emphasis on the poor, vulnerable and marginalized
segments of the population.[fn:51] Achieving UHC will lead to
stronger, more efficient and more equitable health systems.

**** 3.5.1 Delivery of direct nutrition interventions

In developing policies and programmes to address nutrition challenges,
it is imperative to give special attention to the nutrition of
mothers, infants and young children. Although different age-groups
need appropriate attention, as identified in the life course approach
(e.g. pre-school children, adolescent girls), ensuring appropriate
nutrition during the first 1,000 days is especially critical, and has
a lasting impact on the survival, health and development of the
individual.

Due to contemporary demographic transitions and resulting changes in
the age structures of populations -- with increased proportions of the
elderly -- actions are also required to provide adequate health and
nutrition support to address the specific needs of the elderly. Direct
nutrition interventions need to be integrated and implemented together
with nutrition-sensitive interventions.

**** /Promote, protect and support breastfeeding/

\startsquarepar

Breastfeeding is one of the most effective ways to improve child
survival and to promote healthy child growth and development. It needs
to be promoted, protected and supported in all
circumstances. Exclusive breastfeeding[fn:52] in the first six months
of life ensures adequate, affordable, acceptable, appropriate and
readily available food security and nutrition on a continuing
basis. Breastfeeding contributes to enjoyment of the highest

six months up to at least 50% by 2025.

**** /Wasting/

Severely wasted children are estimated to be, on average, 11 times
more likely to die than their healthy counterparts.[fn:53] The global
target to reduce and maintain childhood wasting to less than 5% by
2025 is adopted by the FFA. Both moderate and severe wasting can be
addressed by the community-based management of malnutrition approach,
comprising of treatment and community awareness raising to facilitate
early detection and treatment. Globally, only around 14% of wasted
children are currently being reached by treatment services.

**** /Stunting/

Childhood stunting remains one of the world’s most fundamental
challenges for improved human development. The global target of 40%
reduction in the number of stunted children under five years of age is
adopted by the FFA. Stunting results from a complex web of individual,
household, environmental, socioeconomic, political and cultural
influences. Direct nutrition interventions need to be integrated and
implemented together with nutrition-sensitive interventions and
actions on social protection, health system strengthening,
breastfeeding, prevention and treatment of diarrhoea and other
infectious diseases, water, sanitation and hygiene, reproductive
health and food safety.

Actions to prevent wasting have direct impacts on stunting, e.g. by
enabling the early detection and treatment of stunting. Therefore,
actions to address wasting and stunting should be coordinated and
integrated for better results.

**** /Childhood overweight and obesity/

Overweight and obese children are at higher risk of developing serious
health problems, including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure,
asthma, other respiratory problems, sleep disorders and liver
diseases. They may also suffer from psychological effects, such as low
self-esteem, depression and social isolation. Childhood overweight and
obesity also increase the risk of adult obesity, NCDs, premature death
and disability in adulthood. Actions to prevent and address childhood
overweight and obesity should start with breastfeeding promotion
(considering its role in reducing the risk of childhood obesity),
healthy school feeding programmes (with the provision of fresh fruits
and vegetables at schools as well as the restriction of
sugar-sweetened beverage consumption) and other policies and
programmes that address the social determinants of health. Food
marketing powerfully influences people’s food choices. Excessive
marketing pressure, particularly on children, has promoted unhealthy
dietary practices. Measures to limit such influences are therefore
needed. Stronger actions at the global level are required for reducing
and preventing childhood overweight and obesity -- in line with the
global target of no increase in childhood overweight by 2025 --
alongside actions to address undernutrition problems.

**** /Anaemia in women of reproductive age/

Lack of vitamins and minerals presents a global public health
problem. Iodine, vitamin A and iron deficiencies are the most
important globally, and present a major threat to health and
development. Iron deficiency anaemia, the most common and widespread
nutritional disorder in the world, especially impairs the health and
wellbeing of women. Anaemia increases the risk of maternal and
neonatal adversities. Failure to improve anaemia consigns millions of
women to impaired health and quality of life, generations of children
to impaired development and learning, and communities and nations to
reduced economic productivity. In order to achieve the global target
of a 50% reduction in anaemia in women of reproductive age by 2025,
direct nutrition interventions need to be implemented together with
strategies to promote healthy and diversified diets are
needed. Implementation of recommendations on provision of healthy
diets in schools and preschools, provision of nutrition education,
treatment and prevention of infectious disease and improved hygiene
and sanitation is also important.

**** 3.5.2 Interventions in health services to improve nutrition

Besides delivering interventions that directly improve nutrition,
health systems also need to deliver other interventions that impact on
nutrition, including promoting health, preventing and treating
infections, and improving women’s reproductive health.

Frequent bouts of infectious diseases, such as acute enteric
infections, are an important cause of child undernutrition, helping to
explain why child undernutrition still exists in populations which are
generally food secure. Infectious diseases -- such as malaria,
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and some neglected tropical diseases --
contribute to the high prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia and
undernutrition in some areas. Worm infestations can impair nutritional
status by causing internal bleeding, diarrhoea and poor absorption of
nutrients. Infections can also cause a loss of appetite which, in
turn, can lead to reduced nutrient intake. Breastfeeding is one way to
provide protection for infants against infections in circumstances of
poor sanitation.

Access to integral health care services that ensure adequate support
for safe pregnancy and delivery for all women is critical to be able
to improve maternal and child health, and to break the
intergenerational cycle of malnutrition in all its forms. Adolescent
pregnancy is associated with higher risk of maternal mortality and
morbidity, stillbirths, neonatal deaths, preterm births and low birth
weight. Women who have very closely spaced pregnancies are more likely
to have maternal anaemia and preterm or low-birth-weight
babies. Efforts to prevent adolescent pregnancy and to encourage
pregnancy spacing are therefore needed.

**** 3.6 Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene

Water is a finite resource essential throughout the food system --
from production to consumption. Agriculture and food production
accounts for more than two thirds of freshwater withdrawals.[fn:54] To
achieve sustainable, healthy diets, more rational water use will be
required, along with changes to consumption patterns. To meet this
challenge, food production systems need to adapt with a combination of
relevant measures. Greater water use conservation, along with other
relevant measures to reduce food -- including water -- waste and loss,
are required to achieve sustainability.

Access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation is recognized as
a human right[fn:55] essential for health, prevention of diarrhoeal
disease, and thus to improve nutrition. Diarrhoea is the second
leading cause of death among children under five, and lack of safe
drinking water -- along with inadequate sanitation and hygiene -- are
major risk factors. Children who are affected by undernutrition are
more likely to die from diarrhoea. In turn, diarrhoea undermines
nutrition by reducing appetite and food absorption.

Over one billion people still practice open defecation. In line with
the global call to action on sanitation, efforts should focus on
improving hygiene, changing social norms, better management of human
waste and waste-water, and completely eliminating the practice of open
defecation by 2025.

**** 3.7 Food Safety and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)

Food safety needs to be integrated into the global food security and
nutrition agenda to make significant progress in improving
nutrition. Food safety problems threaten the nutritional status of
populations, particularly vulnerable groups like the elderly, pregnant
women and children. Food contaminated by chemical or biological
hazards, including environmental pollutants, is the origin of many
diseases, ranging from diarrhoea to cancer, undermining people’s
lives, health and nutrition well- being, directly and
indirectly.[fn:56]

Morbidity due to diarrhoea, dysentery and other enteric diseases --
arising from unsafe food, contaminated water and poor sanitation --
has not declined much over recent decades. In some developing
countries, children are chronically exposed, through their diets, to
aflatoxins, which are not only carcinogenic, but also probably
contribute to stunting.

\noindent The FFA sets out the following five recommended actions on
food safety and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) (Recommendations
53--57):

#+attr_latex: :options [leftmargin=*]
+ Recommendation 53: Develop, establish, enforce and strengthen, as
  appropriate, food control systems, including reviewing and
  modernizing national food safety legislation and regulations to
  ensure that food producers and suppliers throughout the food chain
  operate responsibly.

+ Recommendation 54: Actively take part in the work of the Codex
  Alimentarius Commission on nutrition and food safety, and implement,
  as appropriate, internationally adopted standards at the national
  level.

+ Recommendation 55: Participate in and contribute to international
  networks to exchange food safety information, including for managing
  emergencies.\footnotemark

+ Recommendation 56: Raise awareness among relevant stakeholders on
  the problems posed by antimicrobial resistance, and implement
  appropriate multisectoral measures to address antimicrobial
  resistance, including prudent use of antimicrobials in veterinary
  and human medicine.

+ Recommendation 57: Develop and implement national guidelines on
  prudent use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals\footnotemark
  according to internationally recognized standards adopted by
  competent international organizations to reduce non-therapeutic use
  of antimicrobials and to phase out the use of antimicrobials as
  growth promoters in the absence of risk analysis as described in
  Codex Code of Practice CAC/RCP61-2005.

used indicators.}
#+END_LATEX

One emerging food safety issue of global concern is antimicrobial
resistance (AMR). While antimicrobial drugs are essential for both
human and animal health and welfare, and critical to food producers’
livelihoods, their misuse has led to growing AMR threats to humans and
agro--ecological environments. Addressing AMR therefore requires a
multisectoral “One Health Approach”, but significant challenges still
remain in translating internationally recognized standards and
guidelines into appropriate national policies and actions.[fn:57]

**** 4 FOLLOW-UP AFTER ICN2
**** Endorsement by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)

The United Nations system -- and particularly FAO and WHO -- has an
important role to play in supporting national and regional efforts,
enhancing international cooperation and monitoring follow-up to the
ICN2.

The ICN2 Rome Declaration on Nutrition recommends the United Nations
General Assembly to endorse the commitments as well as the policy
options provided in the FFA for implementation. Endorsement by the
UNGA ensures high-level political commitment to address nutrition
challenges across sectors, and the involvement of a wide range of UN
agencies, programmes and funds, as well as other international and
regional organizations, in achieving the commitments of the Rome
Declaration on Nutrition and supporting implementation of actions
recommended in the FFA within their respective mandates. Engagement of
the UNGA will also facilitate more direct input and links to the
development and implementation of the Post-2015 Sustainable
Development Goals.

**** Time Frame for Implementation of the FFA

The actions recommended by the FFA will be implemented over a ten-year
time frame (2016--2025), in line with the Rome Declaration on
Nutrition.

**** Accountability Mechanisms

Effective mechanisms for accountability are essential for ensuring
that the commitments of the Rome Declaration on Nutrition are followed
through, to track progress being made, and to enable people to hold
duty bearers, policymakers and institutions accountable.

#+END_CENTER

#+BEGIN_small

\noindent The FFA sets out the following three recommended actions to
ensure accountability (Recommendations 58--60):

#+attr_latex: :options [leftmargin=*]
+ Recommendation 58: National governments are encouraged to establish
  nutrition targets and intermediate milestones, consistent with the
  timeframe for implementation (2016--2025), as well as global nutrition
  and noncommunicable disease targets established by the World Health
  Assembly. They are invited to include -- in their national monitoring
  frameworks -- agreed international indicators for nutrition outcomes
  (to track progress in achieving national targets), nutrition programme
  implementation (including coverage of interventions) and the nutrition
  policy environment (including institutional arrangements, capacities
  and investments in nutrition). Monitoring should be conducted, to the
  fullest possible extent, through existing mechanisms.

+ Recommendation 59: Reports on implementation of the commitments of
  the Rome Declaration on Nutrition will be compiled jointly by FAO
  and WHO, in close collaboration with other United Nations agencies,
  funds and programmes and other relevant regional and international
  organizations, as appropriate, based on country self-assessments as
  well as information available through other monitoring and
  accountability mechanisms (e.g. Scaling Up Nutrition self-assessment
  reports, reports to the FAO Conference and the World Health
  Assembly, and the Global Nutrition Report).

+ Recommendation 60: The governing bodies of FAO and WHO, and other
  relevant international organizations are requested to consider the
  inclusion of reports on the overall follow-up to ICN2 on the agendas
  of the regular FAO and WHO governing body meetings, including FAO
  regional conferences and WHO regional committee meetings, possibly on
  a biennial basis. The Directors-General of FAO and WHO are also
  requested to transmit such reports to the United Nations General
  Assembly as appropriate.

complemented by other measures to capture the complexity of food
security in its multiple dimensions as this headline number for world
hunger only tells part of the story of undernutrition. For this
reason, FAO has developed a suite of indicators to measure different
dimensions of food security, including availability, access to,
stability, and utilization (nutrition). Information thus generated can
shed light on specific problems to be addressed, and point the way to
appropriate policy actions. FAO has also developed the Food Insecurity
Experience Scale (FIES) as a tool to fill a crucial gap in global food
security monitoring, particularly for assessing access to food at
individual and household levels. The FIES directly measures the
severity of food insecurity, defined as the extent of difficulty in
obtaining food.

[fn:4] Another indicator, Prevalence of Food Inadequacy(3), which uses
a dietary energy requirement benchmark corresponding to minimum
dietary energy needs associated with intense level of physical
activity, showed an even higher number of persons, 2.6 billion, to be
facing dietary inadequacy. For further details, see citet:sofi2012,
Annex 2.

of malnutrition on productivity and cognitive abilities.

[fn:6] In addition, about 20 percent of fruits and vegetables are lost
during the process of harvesting, picking, and sorting, and therefore
do not even enter the supply chain. Also, about 19 percent of fruits
and vegetables globally are wasted by retailers and consumers because
of poor storage and excessive servings parencite:faofoodloss2011.

[fn:12] In addition, about 700,000 households in Mexico were covered
by the \index{Mexico!Programa de Apoyo Alimentario} Programa de Apoyo
Alimentario (PAL) in 2012. The PAL covers marginalized communities
which cannot fulfil conditionalities of Oportunidades because of
non-availability of schools and health facilities. Households covered
by PAL can either opt to get a fixed food basket from the
Distribuidora Compañía Nacional de Subsistencias Populares (DICONSA)
store, or an equivalent amount of money.

[fn:13] In a review of targeted programmes, citet:coady2004targeting
observe that "in most cases it appears that corruption and theft
contribute more to total program expenses than legitimate
administrative expenses". Various contributions in
citet:weiss2005targeting record serious problems of corruption and
malpractices in targeted programmes in Asia.

minerals and trace elements) are met specific to the person’s gender,
age, physical activity level and physiological state. WHO indicates
that for diets to be healthy (a) daily needs of energy, vitamins and
minerals should be met, but energy intake should not exceed needs; (b)
consumption of fruit and vegetables is over 400 g per day; (c) intake
of saturated fats is less than 10% of total energy intake; (d) intake
of trans-fats is less than 1% of total energy intake; (e) intake of
free sugars is less than 10% of total energy intake or, preferably,
less than 5%; (f) intake of salt is less than 5 g per day. For more

[fn:60] To address these concerns, and additional concerns that the
SUN movement's own approach to conflict of interest is much too
permissive, the Geneva-based Global Social Observatory (GSO) was
requested to conduct a Consultation Process on Conflict of Interest in
the SUN movement. The Final Report of the consultation, published in
April 2015, included the following observation: “There is a
fundamental inconsistency between the SUN Principles of Engagement and
the varied national approaches to implementing the International Code
of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.  Consistent, authoritative
guidance is neededistent, authoritative guidance is needed from ‘those
with the mandates at the global level'.” The work of GSO itself raises
questions about the attempt to regulate action through promulgation of
principles. In a comment in the /British Medical Journal/, Judith
Richter notes that the approach taken by GSO blurs key distinctions
between diverging opinions among actors, differing fiduciary
responsibilities of market-led and public-interest actors, and
conflicts of interest pertaining to individual or institutional vested
interests. “This blurred terminology,” she adds, “hinders SUN
participants' understanding of the ultimate aim of conflict of
interest policies: i.e., the protection of integrity, independence and
public trust in persons and institutions serving public interests”

[fn:65] The term “United Nations” is inherently ambiguous, as it can
refer to either the UN member-states who collectively comprise the
United Nations, or to the Secretariat, or both. Thus it is
conventional among specialists and diplomats to refer to the “UN
system” when referring to the UN specialized agencies, funds, and
programmes. This practice is followed herein. The terms “UN system”
and “UN agencies” always refer to the specialized agencies of the
United Nations including the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund, UN funds, and UN programmes, each of which has its own respective
mandates and governing bodies, as well as the United Nations
Secretariat, led by the Secretary-General.
