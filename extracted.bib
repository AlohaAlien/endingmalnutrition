@article{Esrey1996,
  Abstract =     {Data collected in the late 1980s from eight
                  countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (Burundi, Ghana,
                  Togo, and Uganda), Asia/North Africa (Sri Lanka and
                  Morocco), and the Americas (Bolivia and Guatemala)
                  were combined and analyzed to test whether
                  incremental health effects regarding diarrhea and
                  nutritional status result from incremental
                  improvements in water and sanitation
                  conditions. Rural (n = 11, 992) and urban (n = 4,
                  888) samples were analyzed separately. Optimal
                  (i.e., on the premises) and intermediate (improved
                  public water). water supplies were compared with
                  unimproved water conditions. Optimal (flush toilets
                  or water-seal latrines) and intermediate (latrines)
                  sanitation levels were compared with unimproved
                  sanitation. Nationally representative (random)
                  samples of ever-married women aged 15--49 years,
                  with or without children, were interviewed in all
                  countries, and children aged 3--36 months with
                  available weight and height data were included in
                  the analyses. Multiple linear regression controlled
                  for household, maternal, and child-level variables;
                  in addition, dummy variables were included for each
                  country. Improvements in sanitation resulted in less
                  diarrhea and in taller and heavier children with
                  each of the three levels of water
                  supply. Incremental benefits in sanitation were
                  associated with less diarrhea and with additional
                  increases in the weights and heights of
                  children. The effects of improved sanitation were
                  greater among urban dwellers than among rural
                  dwellers. Health benefits from improved water were
                  less pronounced than those for sanitation. Benefits
                  from improved water occurred only when sanitation
                  was improved and only when optimal water was
                  present. These findings suggest that public health
                  interventions should balance epidemiologic data with
                  the cost of services and the demand for water. There
                  should be efforts to develop compatible technologies
                  so that incremental improvements in service can be
                  made.},

@article{Pineda1998,
  Abstract =     {The technology for fortifying sugar with vitamin A
                  was developed in Guatemala in the mid-1970s, and the
                  Guatemalan government enacted legislation to make
                  fortification mandatory in June 1974. This action
                  was copied by other Central American
                  governments. The fortification programme in
                  Guatemala developed in two stages. In the first
                  (1975-77), the fortification programme was evaluated
                  four times at six-month intervals and was shown to
                  be effective. The sugar industry was responsible for
                  carrying out the programme, but the programme was
                  suspended, mainly because of economic
                  arguments. After 10 years of effort, the programme
                  was restarted in 1989. At this time the programme
                  was combined with an initial mass distribution of
                  vitamin A capsules to pre-school children, which
                  began the first successful social mobilization
                  effort in the area. The programme was evaluated for
                  six months and was shown to be effective in
                  improving the vitamin A status of the Guatemalan
                  population. This sec- ond stage has been active
                  continuously since 1989. With improvements in the
                  technology of fortification, new approaches have
                  been tested, and now it is possible to obtain an
                  excellent sugar doubly fortified with vitamin A and
                  iron, using new iron products of high
                  bioavailability that do not alter the organoleptic
                  characteristics of the sugar and do not produce
                  unwanted colour changes during processing. To avoid
                  the rancidity of premixes, new processes of dry
                  mixing have been developed in which no oil is used,
                  This opens a real possibility for the fortification
                  of sugar with other nutrients. Sugar fortified with
                  vitamin A, iron, and zinc, either alone or in any
                  combination, is commercially available in Brazil,
                  where, under the guidance of the Latin American
                  Centre of Nutrition and Metabolic Studies (CELANEM),
                  the procedures have been developed using iron amino
                  acid chelated minerals.},

@article{Rengel199927,
  Abstract =     {Increased micronutrient density in grain destined
                  for human consumption may alleviate micronutrient
                  deficiencies (Fe, Zn, Cu, and I) in human
                  populations around the world. The review of
                  literature indicates that fertilization with
                  inorganic and organic forms of micronutrients has a
                  potential to increase their concentrations in
                  grain. The most effective fertilization could be via
                  soil (for Zn and, to some extent, Cu), foliarly (for
                  Fe) and by adding fertilizers to the irrigation
                  water (for iodine). Care should be exercised not to
                  overfertilize crops with micronutrients because of
                  consequent toxicity and losses in quality and
                  quantity of grain yield. Effectiveness of various
                  agricultural measures in increasing micronutrient
                  density depends on soil type, crop, cultivar,
                  rotation, and environmental and other factors, thus
                  necessitating development of a specific set of
                  measures for individual regions. Agricultural
                  measures would need to be supplemented with
                  appropriate changes in the milling technology to
                  ascertain that increased micronutrient
                  concentrations in some grain parts are passed into
                  the food chain. },

  Abstract =     {The inadequate availability of drinking water and
                  proper sanitation, especially in rural India, leads
                  to innumerable deadly diseases, harms the
                  environment, and also affects vulnerable
                  populations, such as persons with disabilities and
                  women, exposing them to sexual violence. Providing
                  access to sanitation facilities in rural areas of
                  India has been on the agenda of the Government of
                  India for the past three decades. However, a
                  reinvigorated thrust to provide adequate sanitation
                  facilities in rural India is the need of the hour,
                  which must be accompanied by constant scrutiny and
                  monitoring, so as to arrive at apt decisions and
                  policies for further action. },

  Abstract =     {The combining of benefits for human nutrition and
                  agricultural productivity, resulting from breeding
                  staple food crops which are more efficient in the
                  micronutrient metal uptake from the soil, and which
                  accumulate more micronutrients into their seeds,
                  results in extremely high ex ante estimates of
                  benefit/costs ratios for investments in agricultural
                  research in this area. This finding derives from the
                  confluence of several complementary factors:* Rates
                  of micronutrient malnutrition are high in developing
                  countries, as are the consequent costs to human
                  welfare and economic productivity. * Because staple
                  foods are eaten in large quantities every day by the
                  malnourished poor, delivery of enriched staple foods
                  (fortified by the plants themselves during growth)
                  can rely on existing consumer behavior. * A
                  significant percentage of the soils in which these
                  staple foods are grown are `deficient' in these
                  micronutrient metals, which has kept crop yields
                  low. In general, these soils in fact contain
                  relatively high total amounts of micronutrient
                  metals. However, because of binding to soil
                  constituents, these nutrients have poor soil
                  availability to staple crop varieties that are
                  currently available to farmers. * Adoption and
                  spread of nutritionally-improved varieties by
                  farmers can rely on profit incentives, either
                  because of agronomic advantages on trace
                  mineral-deficient soils or incorporation of
                  nutritional improvements in the most productive
                  varieties being released by agricultural research
                  stations. * Benefits to relatively small investments
                  in agricultural research may be disseminated widely,
                  potentially accruing to hundreds of millions of
                  people and millions of hectares of cropland. *
                  Benefits from breeding advances, derived from
                  initial, fixed costs, typically do not involve high
                  recurring costs, and thus tend to be highly
                  sustainable as long as an effective domestic
                  agricultural research infrastructure is
                  maintained. },

  Abstract =     {Abstract About half of the world population suffers
                  from the malnutrition of iron, zinc, calcium, iodine
                  and selenium. Most of the major staple crops of the
                  world, such as rice, wheat, cassava, beans, sweet
                  potato, pearl millet or maize are often deficient in
                  some of these mineral elements. Hence, increasing
                  the concentration of bioavailable micronutrients in
                  edible crop tissues (biofortification) has become a
                  promising strategy in modern agriculture, allowing
                  the access of more nutritious foods, to more people,
                  with the use of fewer resources. Traditional
                  agricultural practices can partly enhance the
                  nutritional value of plant foods, but the advances
                  in the `omics' technologies are rapidly being
                  exploited to engineer crops with enhanced key
                  nutrients. Ionomics, or the study of the ionome
                  (which can be defined as the mineral trace element
                  composition of a particular organism), is a modern
                  functional genomics tool that can provide high
                  throughput information about the broad spectrum
                  nutrient composition of a given plant food. In
                  alliance with other `omics' technologies, such as
                  genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics it can be
                  used to identify numerous genes with important roles
                  in the uptake, transport and accumulation of mineral
                  nutrients in plant foods, in particular in their
                  edible parts. This review provides a critical
                  comparison of the strategies that have been
                  developed to diminish nutrient deficiencies in
                  plant-based foods (SWOT analysis) and a summary of
                  the gene families involved in the mineral nutrient
                  pathways. Finally, it also discusses how `omics'
                  techniques can be used in genetic engineering
                  programs to increase mineral levels and
                  bioavailability in the most important staple food
                  crops and the socioeconomic implications of
                  plant-based biofortified foods. },

@article{darmon2008,
  Abstract =     {A large body of epidemiologic data show that diet
                  quality follows a socioeconomic gradient. Whereas
                  higher-quality diets are associated with greater
                  affluence, energy-dense diets that are nutrient-poor
                  are preferentially consumed by persons of lower
                  socioeconomic status (SES) and of more limited
                  economic means. As this review demonstrates, whole
                  grains, lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy products,
                  and fresh vegetables and fruit are more likely to be
                  consumed by groups of higher SES. In contrast, the
                  consumption of refined grains and added fats has
                  been associated with lower SES. Although
                  micronutrient intake and, hence, diet quality are
                  affected by SES, little evidence indicates that SES
                  affects either total energy intakes or the
                  macronutrient composition of the diet. The observed
                  associations between SES variables and diet-quality
                  measures can be explained by a variety of
                  potentially causal mechanisms. The disparity in
                  energy costs between energy-dense and nutrient-dense
                  foods is one such mechanism; easy physical access to
                  low-cost energy-dense foods is another. If higher
                  SES is a causal determinant of diet quality, then
                  the reported associations between diet quality and
                  better health, found in so many epidemiologic
                  studies, may have been confounded by unobserved
                  indexes of social class. Conversely, if limited
                  economic resources are causally linked to
                  low-quality diets, some current strategies for
                  health promotion, based on recommending high-cost
                  foods to low-income people, may prove to be wholly
                  ineffective. Exploring the possible causal relations
                  between SES and diet quality is the purpose of this
                  review.},

  Abstract =     {Highest rates of obesity and diabetes in the United
                  States are found among the lower-income groups. The
                  observed links between obesity and socioeconomic
                  position may be related to dietary energy density
                  and energy cost. Refined grains, added sugars, and
                  added fats are among the lowest-cost sources of
                  dietary energy. They are inexpensive, good tasting,
                  and convenient. In contrast, the more nutrient-dense
                  lean meats, fish, fresh vegetables, and fruit
                  generally cost more. An inverse relationship between
                  energy density of foods (kilojoules per gram) and
                  their energy cost (dollars per megajoule) means that
                  the more energy-dense diets are associated with
                  lower daily food consumption costs and may be an
                  effective way to save money. However, economic
                  decisions affecting food choice may have physiologic
                  consequences. Laboratory studies suggest that
                  energy-dense foods and energy-dense diets have a
                  lower satiating power and may result in passive
                  overeating and therefore weight gain. Epidemiologic
                  analyses suggest that the low-cost energy-dense
                  diets also tend to be nutrient poor. If the rise in
                  obesity rates is related to the growing price
                  disparity between healthy and unhealthy foods, then
                  the current strategies for obesity prevention may
                  need to be revised. Encouraging low-income families
                  to consume healthier but more costly foods to
                  prevent future disease can be construed as an
                  elitist approach to public health. Limiting access
                  to inexpensive foods through taxes on frowned upon
                  fats and sweets is a regressive measure. The broader
                  problem may lie with growing disparities in incomes
                  and wealth, declining value of the minimum wage,
                  food imports, tariffs, and trade. Evidence is
                  emerging that obesity in America is a largely

                  public distribution system leakages using the latest
                  available data. Leakages remain high, but there is
                  clear evidence of improvement in recent years,
                  especially in states -- including Bihar -- that have
                  undertaken bold PDS reforms. The main source of
                  leakages is the "above the poverty line" quota,
                  which is due to be phased out under the National
                  Food Security Act. },

@book{garcia2012cash,
  Abstract =     {The results of the review do not disappoint. The
                  authors identified more than 120 cash transfer
                  programs that were implemented between 2000 and
                  mid-2009 in Sub-Saharan Africa. These programs have
                  varying objectives, targeting, scale, conditions,
                  technologies, and more. A sizable number of these
                  programs conducted robust impact evaluations that
                  provide important information, presented here, on
                  the merits of cash transfer programs and their
                  specific design features in the African context. The
                  authors present summary information on programs,
                  often in useful graphs, and provide detailed
                  reference material in the appendixes. They highlight
                  how many of the cash transfer programs in Africa
                  that had not yet begun implementation at the time of
                  writing will continue to provide important
                  evaluation results that will guide the design of
                  cash transfer programs in the region. In addition to
                  presenting data and analysis on the mechanics of the
                  programs, the authors discuss issues related to
                  political economy. They highlight the importance of
                  addressing key tradeoffs in cash transfers,
                  political will, and buy-in, and they emphasize the
                  need to build evidence-based debates on cash
                  transfer programs. Useful anecdotes and discussion
                  illustrate how some programs have dealt with these
                  issues with varying degrees of success. This text
                  will serve as a useful reference for years to come
                  for those interested in large- and small-scale
                  issues of cash transfer implementation, both in
                  Africa and beyond. However, the book is not an end
                  in itself. It also raises important questions that
                  must be addressed and knowledge gaps that must be
                  filled. Therefore, it is useful both in the
                  information it provides and in the issues and
                  questions it raises.},

@article{gautamlivestock2009,
  Abstract =     {The demand for milk and milk products is rapidly
                  increasing with achievement of high economic growth
                  in India. Chances that demand growth will surpass
                  the output growth are high. In the past, substantial
                  increment in production was achieved with the
                  implementation of a comprehensive dairy development
                  programme operation flood. It is contented that the
                  future increase in milk production will have to be
                  met by increasing the productivity of dairy
                  animals. However, productivity augmentations are
                  difficult to come by in the given
                  circumstances. While proposing that greater
                  availability of concentrate feeds was primarily
                  responsible for improved production in the past, it
                  is opined that available technology is of limited
                  use in supporting future productivity
                  improvement. Similarly, genetic improvement of
                  animals, which was largely responsible for milk
                  production increases in the past, will prove
                  contentious. Constraints in the supply of feed and
                  fodder are also highlighted. Hindrances in the
                  delivery of veterinary support services, which are
                  likely to play a crucial role, are outlined. Lack of
                  research and development support and adequate market
                  access to smallholders as factors contributing to
                  the list of challenges are identified. Issues of
                  contemporary market failing to incentivise the
                  producers are highlighted besides identifying the
                  reasons for resistance to shift to neo-liberal
                  market structures. Finally, climate change, as
                  having direct and indirect adverse effects on the
                  production, is identified as a factor adding to the
                  complexity of situation. While seeking to analyse
                  the current challenges confronting the Indian dairy
                  sector in the face of imminent demand increases, it
                  is concluded that a multifaceted programme of the
                  nature and extent of operation flood is needed. It
                  is suggested that this will provide the much
                  required momentum to different components of the
                  milk production system.},

  Abstract =     {Poverty affects a large proportion of the population
                  in Sub-Saharan Africa and, far from decreasing, the
                  proportion and numbers of poor people in Sub-Saharan
                  Africa have actually increased over the last ten
                  years. Policies to reduce poverty in Sub-Saharan
                  Africa (SSA) and elsewhere are defying conventional
                  wisdom. Single-focus solutions have proved
                  ineffective. There is an urgent need to learn from
                  both successful and failed experiences that have
                  been tried elsewhere. This study provides an ex-ante
                  assessment of the implementation of a cash transfer
                  programme conditional on school attendance in 15
                  Sub-Saharan African countries. Conditional cash
                  transfer (CCT) programmes have been tried in other
                  regions, notably Latin America, with relative
                  success. The two key characteristics of CCT
                  programmes are that they simultaneously act upon the
                  short and long term dimensions of poverty. Therefore
                  we investigate here both the impact of a cash
                  transfer on current poverty and the impact of
                  conditioning the transfer upon school attendance.},

  Abstract =     {Contributions made by five groups of investigators
                  to the knowledge of the stability of different
                  iodine compounds in salt, and of the extent of the
                  losses of iodine which may occur when iodized salt
                  is exposed to different conditions of storage and
                  use, are discussed by the author. Stability of the
                  iodine component in iodized salt is determined by:
                  (1) moisture content of the salt and humidity of the
                  atmosphere; (2) light, heat, and other
                  meteorological factors; (3) impurities in the salt;
                  (4) acidity or alkalinity of the mixture; and (5)
                  the form in which iodine is present. When potassium
                  iodide or sodium iodide is used as the iodizing
                  agent, the iodide content of the salt will remain
                  constant and its distribution will remain uniform
                  for many months if the salt is packed dry in a
                  container with an impervious lining and kept dry,
                  preferably in a cool place and away from strong
                  light. When these conditions cannot be met, it is
                  desirable to iodize salt with potassium
                  iodate. Under adverse conditions of moisture, heat,
                  and sunlight, the iodine content of salt iodized
                  with potassium iodate remains relatively constant.},

                  open market in the past decade by matching official
                  offtake figures with household purchase reported by

                  diversion of pds grain remains a serious issue;
                  however there are interesting contrasts at the state

                  purchase of pds grain and estimated diversion,
                  states are categorised into three groups -
                  "functioning", "reviving" and "languishing"
                  states. The paper also discusses the possible
                  reasons for the improvement in the pds in the
                  reviving states and questions the assessment of the
                  pds as uniformly and irreversibly dysfunctional.},

                  evaluation and other studies of IRDP show that a
                  very small percentage of the intended beneficiaries
                  have succeeded in deriving any real benefit In all
                  probability the successful cases are those who
                  belong to the better off categories and who are
                  really not eligible for the scheme WHEN the
                  Integrated Rural Development Programme was launched
                  with great fanfare it was thought that something
                  spectacular was going to happen in rural India. But
                  it turned out to be a miserable scheme of giving
                  loans to the poor with an element of subsidy for
                  some small asset like a buffalo. In the beginning
                  the poor were not even aware of it and better-off
                  farmers got the buffaloes in the name of their
                  servants who were just asked to affix their
                  signature/thumb impression on the application
                  form. There were cases when corrupt lower
                  functionaries at the block level misappropriated the
                  loan on the basis of fake applications. When the
                  racket assumed serious proportions it became
                  mandatory to affix a photograph of the applicant but
                  this did not end the mischief In rural areas there
                  are indigent persons who need small sums to meet
                  their daily requirements or to repay small
                  consumption loans. A small amount used to be paid to
                  them for signing the application form; the loan
                  amount would be withdrawn; the subsidy, usually
                  331/3 per cent of the loan, would be pocketed and
                  the rest paid back to the bank. Thus targets were
                  fulfilled and the recovery was cent per cent as also
                  speedy and the corrupt village development officer
                  (VDO) would get approbation for overfulfilment of
                  targets and more importantly for quick recovery of
                  loans. Incidentally, VDOs were previously known as
                  'gram sewaks', i.e, village servants. They resented
                  being called 'gram sewaks' and considered it
                  derogatory. They agitated for a change in their
                  designation and now they are known as village
                  development officers. One can understand the
                  commitment of such functionaries who have descended
                  on the rural areas.},

@article{mayes2011,
  Abstract =     {Staple crops face major challenges in the near
                  future and a diversification away from over-reliance
                  on staples will be important as part of the progress
                  towards the goal of achieving security of food
                  production. Underutilized or neglected crops species
                  are often indigenous ancient crop species which are
                  still used at some level within the local, national
                  or even international communities, but have the
                  potential to contribute further to the mix of food
                  sources than they currently do. The most
                  cost-effective and easily disseminated changes that
                  can be made to a crop are changes to the genetics,
                  as these are contained within the seed itself and,
                  for many species, the seed is a pure breeding,
                  self-replicating, resource. This article focuses on
                  the potential of underutilized crops to contribute
                  to food security and, in particular, whether
                  genetics and breeding can overcome some of the
                  constraints to the enhanced uptake of these species
                  in the future. The focus here is on overview rather
                  than detail and subsequent articles will examine the
                  current evidence base.},

  Abstract =     {Summary Biofortification is increasingly seen as an
                  additional tool to combat micronutrient
                  malnutrition. This paper estimates the costs and
                  potential benefits of biofortification of globally
                  important staple food crops with provitamin A, iron,
                  and zinc for twelve countries in Africa, Asia, and
                  Latin America. Using a modification of the
                  Disability-Adjusted Life Years framework we conclude
                  that overall, the intervention can make a
                  significant impact on the burden of micronutrient
                  deficiencies in the developing world in a highly
                  cost-effective manner. Results differ by crop,
                  micronutrient, and country; and major reasons
                  underlying these differences are identified to
                  inform policy. },

  Abstract =     {Biofortification, the process of breeding nutrients
                  into food crops, provides a sustainable, long-term
                  strategy for delivering micronutrients to rural
                  populations in developing countries. Crops are being
                  bred for higher levels of micronutrients using both
                  conventional and transgenic breeding methods;
                  several conventional varieties have been released,
                  while additional conventional and transgenic
                  varieties are in the breeding pipeline. The results
                  of efficacy and effectiveness studies, as well as
                  recent successes in delivery, provide evidence that
                  biofortification is a promising strategy for
                  combating hidden hunger. This review highlights
                  progress to date and identifies challenges faced in
                  delivering biofortified crops. },

  Abstract =     {This paper, in two parts, reports an evaluation of
                  existing in-kind food transfers. Part I outlines the
                  dimensions involved, in terms of reach, transfer
                  content and physical leakages, and deals with the
                  impact of these transfers on poverty as officially
                  measured. Part II reports the impact of these
                  transfers on calorie intakes and also discusses some
                  issues regarding the financial cost of these
                  transfers. Contrary to the view that food
                  self-sufficiency and income growth have reduced the
                  need for direct food interventions, the paper
                  reports a significant increase in contribution of
                  in-kind transfers to both poverty reduction and
                  nutrition. Moreover, much of this increased impact
                  is attributable to improved public distribution
                  system efficiency. The first part, presented here,
                  was motivated by some issues that arose in the
                  context of the Tendulkar method of estimating
                  poverty as regards its treatment of food
                  prices. This method treats food prices differently
                  from the earlier Lakdawala method and is sensitive
                  to treatment of in-kind food transfers. The paper
                  suggests a decomposition method that modifies the
                  Tendulkar poverty lines and distinguishes between
                  household out-of-pocket expenditures and transfers
                  received from the PDS and mid-day meals. The poverty
                  reducing impact of these food transfers is found to
                  have increased over time and is more pronounced in
                  the case of distribution-sensitive measures of
                  poverty. },

  Abstract =     {The challenge of feeding 9 to 10 Billion people by
                  2050 may seem like a big enough challenge in itself,
                  but we also need to achieve this feat whilst, at the
                  same time, reducing adverse impacts of food
                  production on a whole range of ecosystem
                  services. One suggested response is ``sustainable
                  intensification'' which entails delivering safer,
                  nutritious food from the same area whilst
                  maintaining ecosystem service provision. In this
                  review, I examine sustainable intensification and
                  consider alternatives such as management of food
                  demand and waste reduction. I conclude that
                  sustainable intensification has a role to play, but
                  this must be accompanied by fundamental change in
                  global food systems. },
