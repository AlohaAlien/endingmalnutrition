# Ending Malnutrition: from commitment to action

This repository has the source files used for producing the book "Ending Malnutrition: from commitment to action". 
All files except official logo files are included. I have also included the biblatex.cfg file, from my local 
texmf directory, since some biblatex customisations are in that file.

I export the org file to latex, and then compile it using compilebook.sh.
